It also expects consolidation and capacity expansion to continue and profitability for these companies to be aided by a low base and cost savings.

Here is what CLSA said for Cement companies going forward:

ACC
| The brokerage has upgraded the Adani Cement company to ""outperform"" from its earlier rating of ""hold"". It has also raised its price target of ₹2,580 from ₹2,500 earlier. The brokerage cited the stock's recent underperformance as the key factor behind the upgrade.

However, it prefers to play the Adani Group's focus on market share gains and profitability uptick through Ambuja.

Ambuja Cements
| CLSA has maintained its outperform rating on the stock but cut its price target to ₹635 from ₹645 earlier. Yet, the revised price target implies a potential upside of 19% from Tuesday's closing levels. Ambuja is slated to commission 14 MT of cement capacity expansion projects and is also likely to make headway on several cost saving initiatives, according to CLSA.

Dalmia Bharat |
The other cement stock that has been upgraded by CLSA to ""outperform"" from its earlier rating of ""hold"" earlier. The brokerage has raised its price target on the stock to ₹2,110 from ₹1,835 earlier, which implies a potential upside of 18% from Tuesday's close. CLSA said that the lack of medium-term growth visibility for Dalmia Bharat is more than factored in at current valuations.

Ambuja Cements Rauri plant closed due to non-compliance of environmental norms.

In a move aimed at ensuring the compliance with green norms, the State Pollution Control Board (SPCB) has imposed an environmental compensation (EC) of Rs 6.6 lakh on Ambuja Cement’s Rauri plant in Darlaghat.

The compensation has been levied for a period of 22 days from December 8 to December 30 for the violation of the provisions of the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981.
A slew of inspections conducted in the plant revealed that the plant machinery was suffering operational snags owing to lack of timely maintenance. Following the observations of the board officials, the plant halted its operations on December 11, 2024, to rectify the defects and ensure the compliance with the rules and regulations.

The EC was imposed following the directions issued by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) to levy penalty on units violating environmental laws.
The board’s Member Secretary, Anil Joshi, issued these orders to levy EC of Rs 6.6 lakh on January 20 after it was found that the plant management had failed to rectify the defects despite repeated inspections and issuance of show-cause notices by officials.

A show-cause notice was issued on December 12 to the plant by the board’s Regional Officer at Parwanoo after the inspection revealed that air pollution was being caused due to rupture in the pre-heat duct. The unit staff had attributed the rupturing to power tripping and had consequently shut the plant.

The officials also observed that pollution was caused in the plant due to kiln tripping and pressurisation of the system, which further ruptured the pre-heater duct.
Another show-cause notice was issued on December 16 to ensure the proper operation of all air pollution control devices and control undue emissions, which trigger air pollution.

Yet another inspection conducted on December 27 revealed that the breakdown of cyclone in the plant was also causing emissions from the unit, thus contributing to environmental pollution. Even the cleaning process of the pre-heater duct was found to cause air pollution on December 15.
The plant was further issued another show-cause notice to ensure the compliance with environmental norms on December 30 and the plant management’s response was awaited.

Cement plants emit large amounts of air pollutants, including sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide and particulate matter, which can have deleterious effects on the health and the environment.
Board’s Regional Officer Anil Kumar said the plant had been shut since December 11 due to non-compliance with the norms.

Hyderabad/ Nalgonda:
The expansion plans of Ambuja Cements, a subsidiary of the Adani Group, are facing stiff opposition in the erstwhile Nalgonda district. Several rural clusters in the region have already been bearing the brunt of pollution caused by the flourishing cement factories.
Ambuja Cements aims to increase its production capacity to 140 million tonnes by 2027-28 in the country. As part of this move, the company sought to expand the limestone mines at the Adani Ambuja Cement Factory located in the Sunnampahad area. The Pollution Control Board scheduled a public hearing on Saturday to gather public opinion on the proposed expansion.
The hearing triggered widespread protests, with people staging demonstrations in the area. Local residents from nearby villages strongly opposed the expansion, expressing their grievances. Farmers lamented that their crops are already affected by dust and ash emanating from the existing factory operations.
They feared that further expansion of limestone mines would add to the pollution problem. It will impact the agricultural operations and livelihoods.
In October 2024, widespread protests were witnessed in the
Ramannapet
area of the
Yadadri-Bhongir
district, against new units proposed by the group. Farmers and weavers were deeply concerned about the potential environmental and social impacts of the factory. The protests gained momentum, with residents fearing that the factory would turn their villages into pollution hotspots, severely affecting their livelihoods.
The weaver and sheep-rearing communities also joined the protests. The public hearing held on October 23, 2024, saw strong opposition, with clashes between the police and protestors. Environmental activists and political leaders also backed the protests, demanding the withdrawal of the factory plans.

Ambuja Cements celebrated a significant financial upturn in the October-December quarter, as its net profit surged more than 100% to Rs 2,620 crore compared to the previous year's Rs 1,091 crore. The Adani Group-affiliated company's operational revenue was reported to have climbed by 15%, reaching Rs 9,329 crore, according to the latest earnings release.

Key drivers behind this growth include strategic acquisitions that bolstered capacity and market footprint, according to Ajay Kapur, Ambuja Cements' Whole Time Director & CEO. The company is targeting further expansions to exceed 104 MTPA capacity by Q4 of 2024-25 and eyes 118 MTPA by 2025-26, highlighting a focused growth trajectory.

Efforts to cut costs have helped boost profitability, including increased usage of low-cost imported Petcoke, and optimized logistics that trimmed costs by five percent. Ambuja cites efficiency investments and digitization as vital components to support its path towards market leadership, as demand is projected to rise due to favorable government policies and expanded housing and infrastructure initiatives.

Ambuja Cement, a flagship company of the Adani Group, has reported a staggering 242% year-on-year (YoY) increase in its standalone net profit for the third quarter of FY25, reaching ₹1,758 crore. This remarkable growth, up from ₹514 crore in the same period last year, is attributed to strategic acquisitions, cost optimization, and record sales volumes.

The cement giant’s performance was further bolstered by a sharp increase in other income, which surged to ₹771.7 crore from ₹108.2 crore YoY, alongside government grants of ₹193 crore. However, the company faced challenges with a 29% decline in EBITDA to ₹600 crore and a contraction in margins by over 700 basis points to 11.9%.
