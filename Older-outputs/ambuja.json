The domestic brokerage assigned 'Buy' calls for UltraTech Cement Ltd, JK Cements Ltd and Ambuja Cements Ltd with a potential upside of up to 29 per cent.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nAxis said UltraTech's capacity expansion plan is progressing well. \"With the expanded capacity and increasing scale, we expect the company to consolidate its market leadership position further and increase its market share from the current 25 per cent to 28 per cent. We anticipate the company will grow its volume at an 11 per cent CAGR over FY24-27E. It expects a cost reduction of Rs 200-300 per tonne in the next 2-3 years. We project that the company's EBITDA margin will increase to 22 per cent in FY27E, driven by higher volume, better realisations, and cost optimisation initiatives,\" the brokerage stated.\n\nBased on the third-quarter (Q3 FY25) results, it has given a target of Rs 13,510, suggesting a likely uptick of 17.56 per cent from today's closing of Rs 11,491.60.\n\nFor JK Cements, Axis said, \"The company delivered a strong operating performance during the quarter, driven by higher realisations and positive operating leverage, resulting in a 54 per cent QoQ (quarter-on-quarter) improvement in EBITDA per tonne, reaching Rs 1,000. This positive trend is expected to continue in Q4 FY25, supported by robust cement demand and better realisations.\"\n\nIt projected the company to grow its volume, revenue, EBITDA, and APAT at a CAGR of 12 per cent, 10 per cent, 25 per cent, and 36 per cent, respectively, over FY24-FY27E. Axis said JK Cements shares may climb 12.10 per cent to hit an upside target of Rs 5,380 from existing levels of Rs 4,799.15.\n\nThe brokerage proposed the maximum thrust in shares of Adani Group-led Ambuja. It has given a target of Rs 655, up 29.31 per cent from Monday's closing level of Rs 506.55.\n\n\"Business initiatives are expected to further lower operating costs by reducing the clinker factor and logistics costs, improving the sale of blended cement, and expanding the EBITDA margin. We forecast the company's EBITDA margins to improve to 18 per cent-19 per cent in FY26E. Strong infrastructure demand and ongoing needs from the housing and commercial sectors are anticipated to boost cement demand in H2 FY25. Strategic investments in roads, railways, and urban and commercial amenities are poised to drive robust growth. The company expects demand for the industry during FY25 to grow in the range of 4-5 per cent,\" the broking house stated.\n\nSharing the outlook for the cement sector, Axis said, \"We remain positive as long-term demand drivers are intact and expect cement demand to grow at a CAGR of 7 per cent-8 per cent over FY24-27E. Sector consolidation is expected to benefit large players through economies of scale, supply chain efficiency, and better pricing in the long term. Despite ongoing capacity additions, we believe long-term cement demand will outpace supply.\"", "source_link":

Explore more on the reasons.", "article_body": "The brokerage firm, Motilal Oswal, has revised its target price for Ambuja Cements lower to Rs 600 from Rs 750. This however, still indicates a 15% upside from the current market price of Rs 522. Although the brokerage firm has cut the target price, it continues to maintain a Buy rating.\n\nLet’s take a look at the 3 key reasons why the firm has revised their stance.\n\n1. Weak realisation and cost pressure\n\nAccording to the brokerage firm, the primary reason for the downgrade in target price is due to a weak realisation coupled with rising operational costs.\n\nIn its report, the firm added that in Q3FY25, Ambuja Cement saw a significant drop in its consolidated EBITDA, which fell by nearly 49% YoY to Rs 8.9 billion. This was much lower than expected, with EBITDA per ton declining by 56% YoY to Rs 537, well below the estimated Rs 848.\n\nFurthermore, the firm in its report added that higher operating costs, especially in newly acquired assets like Sanghi and Penna Cement, added pressure to earnings.\n\n“The company is currently focusing on various cost-reduction initiatives as it navigates through the transition phase of its newly acquired assets,” added the firm in its report.\n\n2. Inorganic growth driving volume, but straining margins\n\nAmbuja Cements reported a volume growth of 17% YoY, with a portion around 10% driven by inorganic expansions from Sanghi and Penna Cement.\n\n“Currently, both companies are in the transition and ramp-up phase. We expect the full benefits of the acquisitions to materialize only by FY26,” said the brokerage firm in its report.\n\nHowever, the management has indicated that plant capacity utilisation is expected to increase to over 70% in FY26. As per the brokerage firm, this progress will likely improve efficiency, but for now, margins are under pressure.\n\n3. Increased exposure to South India, where prices remain depressed\n\nAnother concern that was raised by the brokerage firm in its report is the increased exposure to South India, a region where cement prices remain relatively low.\n\n“Although the company has implemented price hikes, the Southern region remains a challenge due to pricing pressures,” the brokerage firm noted in its report.\n\nAccording to the brokerage firm, this impacts overall profitability. ACEM’s inorganic expansions in the South are yet to provide the desired financial uplift, adding further pressure to the company’s earnings.\n\nAmbuja Cement Q3FY25 performance\n\nAmbuja Cement, part of the Adani Group on January 29 announced its financial results for the quarter ending December 31, 2024. The company reported a 242% increase in standalone net profit for Q3FY25, reaching Rs 1,758 crore, up from Rs 514 crore in the same quarter last year. Moreover, the revenue also saw a 10% rise to Rs 4,850 crore compared to Rs 4,422 crore in Q3FY24.\n\nFurthermore, Ambuja Cement’s board has approved an open offer to acquire up to 26% stake in Orient Cement at Rs 395.4 per share.\n\nStock performance of Ambuja Cement\n\nPost the announcement of the Q3 results, Ambuja Cement’s share price is trading at Rs 500.20, down by 4.19% during the intraday trading session.\n\nThe share price of Ambuja Cement has dropped significantly in recent times, falling by 9.98% over the past five days. In the last six months, it posted a sharp 25.79% decline, and in the past year, the stock price has decreased by 12.34%.\n\nThe company holds a market capitalisation of Rs 1.10 lakh crore. Its 52-week high of Rs 706.95 seems far off, with the stock now hovering near its 52-week low of Rs 453.05.", "source_link": "https://www.financialexpress.com/market/why-has-motilal-oswal-cut-target-price-for-ambuja-cements-3-reasons-are-3730997/", "keywords": ["ambuja cement share price", "ambuja cement share price today", "ambuja cement q3fy25", "Ambuja Cements Target Price Revision", "Ambuja Cements Q3FY25 Results", "Ambuja Cements Weak Realisation", "Ambuja Cements Cost Pressure", "Ambuja Cements EBITDA"], "tags": [], "article_images": "https://www.financialexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Ambuja.jpg", "all_images": ["https://www.financialexpress.com/wp-content/themes/ie-network-theme/ctd-classic/images/linkedin.svg", "https://www.financialexpress.com/wp-content/themes/ie-network-theme/ctd-classic/images/linkedin-icon.svg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=444470064056909&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://www.financialexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Stocks-on-blocks-Freepik-2.jpg?w=250", "https://www.financialexpress.com/wp-content/themes/ie-network-theme/ctd-classic/images/facebook-icon.svg", "https://www.financialexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Stocks-chart-on-screen-Pixabay-2.jpg?w=250", "https://www.financialexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/1200x675-6.jpg?w=250", "https://data.indianexpress.com/election2019/track_1x1.jpg", "https://www.financialexpress.com/wp-content/themes/ie-network-theme/ctd-classic/images/apple_stor.svg", "https://www.financialexpress.com/wp-content/themes/ie-network-theme/ctd-classic/images/facebook.svg", "https://www.financialexpress.com/wp-content/themes/ie-network-theme/ctd-classic/images/twitter.svg", "https://www.financialexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/uber.jpg?w=250", "https://www.financialexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/diya-2025-02-13T191550.836.jpg?w=250", "https://www.financialexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Elon-Musk-vs-DeepSeek_20250209055048_20250213134351.png?w=250", "https://www.financialexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Mukesh-Ambani-1.jpg?w=250", "https://www.financialexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/tata-steel.reuters.jpg?w=250", "https://www.financialexpress.com/wp-content/themes/ie-network-theme/ctd-classic/images/play_stor.svg", "https://www.financialexpress.com/wp-content/themes/ie-network-theme/assets/src/img/default-ie.jpg", "https://www.financialexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/FE-1200x675-37.jpg?w=250", "https://www.financialexpress.com/wp-content/themes/ie-network-theme/ctd-classic/images/vip-powered-logo.png", "https://www.financialexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Ambuja.jpg?w=1024", "https://www.financialexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Nirmala-Sitharaman-ANI_20250203050912_20250213135456.jpg?w=250", "https://www.financialexpress.com/wp-content/themes/ie-network-theme/ctd-classic/images/twitter-icon.svg", "https://www.financialexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Ambuja.jpg", "https://www.financialexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Tejas-aircraft-HAL.jpg?w=250", "https://www.financialexpress.com/wp-content/themes/ie-network-theme/assets/src/img/lazy_placeholder.gif"], "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "keywords": "ambuja cement share price, ambuja cement share price today, ambuja cement q3fy25, Ambuja Cements Target Price Revision, Ambuja Cements Q3FY25 Results, Ambuja Cements Weak Realisation, Ambuja Cements Cost Pressure, Ambuja Cements EBITDA", "news_keywords": "ambuja cement share price, ambuja cement share price today, ambuja cement q3fy25, Ambuja Cements Target Price Revision, Ambuja Cements Q3FY25 Results, Ambuja Cements Weak Realisation, Ambuja Cements Cost Pressure, Ambuja Cements EBITDA", "description": "Motilal Oswal cuts Ambuja Cements target price.

Shareholders of Sanghi will get 12 shares of Ambuja for every 100 held.\n\nPenna Cements that the Adani group acquired earlier this year for $1.3 billion, is the larger entity with an annual operational capacity of 10 million ton, with four integrated plans in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana and a grinding unit in Maharashtra. It has two plants with a combined capacity of 4 million tons coming up while it has 5 bulk cement terminals.\n\nSanghi Industries was acquired by Ambuja in late 2023 for an enterprise value of ₹5,185 crore. With its acquisition, Ambuja expanded its clinker capacity by 6 million tonnes, cement capacity by another 6 million tonnes, got access to 1 billion tons of limestone reserves, along with a captive jetty and power plant.\n\n“It’s a win-win situation for both the Adani group as well as Sanghi, Penna,” said Kranti Bathini, Director of Equity Strategy at WealthMills Securities. said.\n\nShare swap ratio explanation\n\nWith respect to the swap ratio, he pointed out that the premium was on the Ambuja side as it was a larger, national player. “From being a regional player, Sanghi is getting a national footprint while the shareholders would be part of a larger group,” he said. This would justify the lopsided share swap. With the merger, Sanghi shareholders would become shareholders of Ambuja Cement.\n\nThe move will streamline organisational structure, simplify compliance requirements, and do-away with related party transactions, said Investec Bank plc (UK) in a note on the merger.\n\nIt added that it was comforted by Ambuja Cements’ management reaffirming their growth plans, costs and synergy targets and on-going initiatives to achieve those targets.", "source_link": "https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/companies/sanghi-ind-shares-fall-on-merger-swap-ratio-with-ambuja-cements/article68999498.ece", "keywords": ["Sanghi industries", "ambuja Cements", "share swap", "adani", "cement industry"], "tags": ["Maharashtra", "Andhra Pradesh", "adani group", "cement", "Elections 2024"], "article_images": "https://bl-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/co4e9a/article68999520.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/2023-08-03T033728Z_1332355368_RC2ELV9NEHJL_RTRMADP_3_SANGHI-INDUST-M-A-AMBUJA-CEMENTS.JPG", "all_images": ["https://assetsbl.thehindubusinessline.com/theme/images/bl-online/menu-icon.svg", "https://assetsbl.thehindubusinessline.com/theme/images/bl-online/logo.svg", "https://assetsbl.thehindubusinessline.com/theme/images/bl-online/1x1_spacer.png", "https://assetsbl.thehindubusinessline.com/theme/images/BLRX/icon/bl-home-btn.png", "https://assetsbl.thehindubusinessline.com/theme/images/BLRX/icon/newsletter.svg", "https://bl-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/co4e9a/article68999520.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/2023-08-03T033728Z_1332355368_RC2ELV9NEHJL_RTRMADP_3_SANGHI-INDUST-M-A-AMBUJA-CEMENTS.JPG", "https://assetsbl.thehindubusinessline.com/theme/images/google-signin/bl-online-icon.svg", "https://assetsbl.thehindubusinessline.com/theme/images/BLRX/graph-arrow-icon.svg", "https://assetsbl.thehindubusinessline.com/theme/images/bl-online/comment-icon.svg", "https://assetsbl.thehindubusinessline.com/theme/images/th-online/1x1_spacer.png", "https://assetsbl.thehindubusinessline.com/theme/images/google-signin/group-12945.svg", "https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/theme/images/th-online/1x1_spacer.png", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=11398210&cs_ucfr=1&cv=4.4.0&cj=1"], "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "title": "Sanghi Industries Shares: Falls on merger swap ratio with Ambuja Cements", "description": "Merger of Sanghi Industries with Ambuja Cements offers Sanghi shareholders national brand, all-India reach, and Adani group benefits;

Broader markets faced the wrath of bears. BSE Sensex cracked 824.29 points, or 1.08 per cent, to end the session at 75,366.17. NSE's Nifty50 plunged 263.05 points, or 1.14 per cent, to settle at 22,829.15 for the day.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nSome buzzing stocks including Bajaj Auto Ltd, Vedanta Ltd and Ambuja Cements Ltd are likely to remain under the spotlight of traders for the session today. Here is what Jigar S Patel, Technical Research Analyst at Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers has to say on these stocks ahead of Tuesday's trading session:\n\nVedanta | Avoid\n\nOn the weekly chart, Vedanta has formed a 3-point negative divergence, indicating weakening momentum despite price increases. The trendline violation confirms bearish sentiment, signalling potential downside. These technical signals suggest a high probability of a correction. Therefore, it is prudent to book profits and wait for a correction of at least 20 per cent from the current price before considering fresh positions. Traders should avoid initiating long positions under current market conditions, as the risk-to-reward ratio is unfavourable, and further downside cannot be ruled out.\n\nBajaj Auto | Buy | Target Price: Rs 9,000 | Stop Loss: Rs 8,100\n\nBajaj Auto has experienced a 35 per cent correction from its peak of Rs 12,774, currently trading near the Rs 8,400 level. The stock is holding a strong historical support zone of 8,300-8,400, which dates back to March 2024. Additionally, the RSI is around 32, indicating that the stock is nearing oversold territory and could be poised for a rebound. Given these technical signals, we recommend going long in the Rs 8,300-8,400 zone with an upside target Rs of 9,000. A strict stop-loss at 8,100 on a daily closing basis should be maintained to manage risk effectively. This setup offers an attractive risk-to-reward ratio.\n\nAmbuja Cements | Book Profit\n\nAmbuja Cements has formed a long-legged doji near its 100-DEMA, followed by a bearish candlestick pattern. The daily RSI has dropped below the critical 50 level, signaling weakening momentum and a bearish outlook. These indicators suggest a higher probability of further downside. Hence, it is advisable to book profits and wait for a correction before considering re-entry. On the flip side, a fresh buying opportunity will only arise if the stock closes above Rs 562 on a daily basis, as this would confirm renewed bullish strength and invalidate the current bearish setup.", "source_link": "https://www.businesstoday.in/markets/company-stock/story/vedanta-ambuja-cements-bajaj-auto-how-to-trade-these-three-buzzing-stocks-462207-2025-01-28", "keywords": ["Stocks to

The company will make an open offer to shareholders of Orient Cement for acquiring an additional 26 per cent at ₹395 per equity share.\n\nThe deal will be funded through internal accruals and is expected to be completed in 3-4 months, said Ambuja Cements in a statement on Tuesday.\n\nTo start with, Ambuja Cements will acquire 7.76 crore equity shares of Orient Cement representing 38 per cent from the promoter group at ₹395.40 per share leading total investment of ₹3,185 crore.\n\nSeparately, Ambuja Cements executed agreement to buy out 1.82 crore equity shares for representing 8.90 per cent from certain public shareholders at ₹395.40 per share. Shares of Orient Cement closed at ₹343. 50 per share on the BSE.\n\nAmbuja Cements will also make an offer to purchase 5.34 crore equity shares constituting 26 per cent at the same price, said the company in a statement.\n\nThe Adani Group forayed into the cement business in September 2022 by buying out Ambuja Cements and its subsidiary ACC Ltd from Switzerland’s Holcim Group for $6.4 billion.\n\nIn April, the Adani family invested ₹8,339 crore in Ambuja Cements to provide ammunition for acquiring asset. Adani Group has been acquiring a series of cement companies to inch closer to the largest player Aditya Birla Group Ultratech. Last year in December, the Adani Group acquired Sanghi Cement and followed it up with Penna Cement buy out for ₹10,422 crore in June.\n\nOrient Cement turnover was up last fiscal at ₹3,185 crore against ₹2,938 crore logged in the same period last year. The turnover was at ₹2,725 crore in FY22.\n\nOrient Cement has an 8.5 mtpa (million tonnes per annum) capacity and can nearly double it by another 8.1 MTPA through brownfield expansion. It also owns a high quality limestone mine at Chittorgarh (Rajasthan) that can support an additional 6 mtpa cement capacity in North India.\n\nThis will take Adani Cement’s operational capacity to 97.4 mtpa, accelerating its plans to achieve over 100 mtpa capacity by next March-end.\n\nThe deal will also help Ambuja Cements to increase its presence by 8.5 mtpa in the core market of South and West India and improve pan-India market share by 2 per cent.\n\nThe large limestone deposit at Chittorgarh (Rajasthan) provides the potential to increase cement grinding capacity by 6 mtpa in the attractive northern narket, it said.\n\nKaran Adani, Director, Ambuja Cements, said OCL assets are highly efficient, equipped with railway sidings and well supported by captive power plants, renewable energy, WHRS and AFR facilities, he said.\n\nIt is also located strategically, high-quality limestone reserves and requisite statutory approvals present an opportunity to increase cement capacity in the near term to 16.6 mtpa, he added.\n\nCK Birla, Chairman, Orient Cement, said the Group is continuously reallocating capital to sharpen its focus on consumer centric, technology driven and service-based businesses.\n\nAdani Group, with its strong focus on cement and infrastructure, is the ideal new owner to drive continued growth at Orient Cement, he added.", "source_link":

UltraTech Cement of Aditya Birla group recently acquired 32.72 per cent stake in India Cement for Rs 3,945 crore from N Srinivasan and family. Both the groups were on an acquisition spree in the cement sector in the last three years.\n\nAmbuja will acquire 46.8 per cent shares of OCL from its current promoters and certain public shareholders. The acquisition will be fully funded through internal accruals. While UltraTech was also in talks to buy OCL, the Adanis finally managed to clinch the deal.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\n“This timed acquisition marks another significant step forward in Ambuja Cements’ accelerated growth journey, increasing cement capacity by 30 MTPA within two years of Ambuja’s acquisition,” said Karan Adani, Director of Ambuja Cements.\n\nBy acquiring OCL, Ambuja is poised to reach 100 MTPA (million tonnes per annum) cement capacity in FY25. The acquisition will help to expand Adani Cement’s presence in core markets and improve its pan-India market share by 2 per cent, the Adani firm said.\n\nOn the other hand, UltraTech’s cement capacity is at 146 MTPA. While Orient Cement shares fell by 2.50 per cent, Ambuja Cements declined by 2.42 per cent on the bourses on Tuesday.\n\n“OCL’s assets are highly efficient, equipped with railway sidings and well supported by captive power plants, renewable energy, WHRS and AFR facilities. OCL’s strategic locations, high-quality limestone reserves and requisite statutory approvals present an opportunity to increase cement capacity in the near term to 16.6 MTPA,” Adani said.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nCK Birla, Chairman of Orient Cement and the CK Birla Group, said, “the CK Birla Group is continuously reallocating capital to sharpen its focus on consumer centric, technology driven and service-based businesses.”\n\nOCL has 5.6 MTPA clinker capacity and 8.5 MTPA cement capacity along with statutory clearance to increase the clinker capacity by another 6.0 MTPA and cement capacity by another 8.1 MTPA. In addition, OCL also has a limestone mining lease in Chittorgarh for setting up an Integrated Unit (IU) with clinker of 4 MTPA and a split Grinding Unit (GU) of 6 MTPA in North India, it said.\n\nIt has also secured a concession from MPPGCL, Madhya Pradesh for setting up a Grinding Unit within the premises of Satpura Thermal Power Plant. Both these complement the Adani Group’s existing cement footprint, Ambuja Cement said.\n\nOCL has recently commissioned a WHRS in Chittapur IU and is in the final stage of commissioning 16 MW solar in Chittapur and 3.7 MW solar in Jalgaon. “OCL’s existing dealers will move to Adani Cement’s market network, creating formidable synergies,” it said.\n\nBIRLA VS ADANI IN CEMENT\n\nAditya Birla cement

The company will acquire 46.8% shares of OCL from its current promoters and certain public shareholders. The acquisition will be fully funded through internal accruals.\"This timed acquisition marks another significant step forward in Ambuja Cements’ accelerated growth journey, increasing cement capacity by ~30 MTPA within two years of Ambuja’s acquisition. By acquiring OCL, Ambuja is poised to reach 100 MTPA cement capacity in FY25. The acquisition will help to expand Adani Cement’s presence in core markets and improve its pan-India market share by 2%.

SEDI not only provided him with the necessary skills through its training programme, but also helped him land a stable job. His story has inspired many others from his village to join SEDI and pursue careers beyond agriculture.\n\nWith his employment, Surendra now contributes to his family’s income, raising their total monthly earnings to Rs. 80 000 significantly improving their quality of life. His success has earned him recognition in his community, where he is seen as a role model for perseverance and hard work.

However, the results beat the CNBC-TV18 poll projection across parameters.The cement maker reported a net profit of ₹500 crore versus the poll expectation of ₹301 crore for the three-month period ended September 2024. In the September 2023 quarter, the net profit stood at ₹633 crore, implying a decline of 22% in the quarter under review.Ambuja Cements’ revenue rose 6% to ₹4,213 crore in the second quarter of FY25 from ₹3969 crore in the corresponding in the previous financial year. The Q2 revenue was 10% higher than the CNBC-TV18 poll projection of ₹3,820 crore.The company's EBITDA, short for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation, at ₹680 crore also came in more than 50% higher than the estimates. In Q2 of FY24, the firm had reported an EBITDA of ₹773 crore.The cement maker's margin declined 340 basis points from 19.5% in the September 2023 quarter to 16.1% in the September 2024 quarter. The CNBC-TV18 poll had projected the margin to come in at 15.2%.Meanwhile, the firm registered a strong volume of 8.7 mt for the quarter under review, versus 7.6 mt in the same quarter a year ago. The analysts polled by CNBC-TV18 had expected the number to come in at 8.1 mt.The cost of power and fuel declined 17% year-on-year to ₹803 crore whereas other expenses have increased 2% to ₹436 crore.The volumes are much higher whereas as costs are lower and it appears that some synergy benefits with Sanghi and Adani Cement group companies are also playing out.The firm's management said, “Performance is supported by healthy volume growth, increasing scale of operations, value extraction of acquired assets, enhanced cost leadership, improved operational efficiencies, and group synergies.”Reflecting on the outlook, the company said that with the recent acquisition of Orient Cement and projects in an advanced stage of completion, its operational capacity shall cross 100+ MTPA by this fiscal year.It added that its net worth is at an all-time high at ₹59,916 crore and Cash and Cash equivalent at ₹10,135 crore.The cement maker added 70 million MT of new limestone reserves secured in Q2 FY25, with total reserves reaching 8.2 billion MT at a premium of < 3%. In addition to this, Orient Cement has substantial high-quality limestone reserves which adds to existing resources. This will help deliver a targeted capacity of 140 MTPA by FY28, the firm said in its presentation.Following the Q2 result, Ambuja Cements shares traded 3.71% higher at ₹573.90 on BSE.", "source_link": "https://www.cnbctv18.com/market/earnings/ambuja-cements-q2-result-profit-and-margin-decline-revenue-rises-in-sept-quarter-beat-estimates-19500178.htm", "keywords": ["Ambuja Cements Q2 result", "ambuja cement results", "ambuja cement q2 earnings", "ambuja cement results today", "ambuja cement q2 revenue", "ambuja cement q2 profit", "ambuja cement results", ""], "tags": ["Ambuja Cements", "Cement stocks", "Featured", "Q2 results"], "article_images": "https://images.cnbctv18.com/uploads/2024/08/ambuja-cements-2024-08-00fa1f1049798052efb0ef7c69d5e5df.jpg?im=FitAndFill,width=500,height=300", "all_images": ["https://www.cnbctv18.com/static/images/CNBC-TV18-logo-black.png", "https://www.cnbctv18.com/static/images/author.png", "https://www.cnbctv18.com/static/images/bingelogo/binge-logo.png?impolicy=website&width=110&height=33", "https://www.cnbctv18.com/static/images/awaz-black.png", "https://www.cnbctv18.com/static/images/CNBC_Bajar.png", "https://www.cnbctv18.com/_next/static/media/gplay_1.fee9ff82.svg", "https://www.cnbctv18.com/static/images/common/cnbctv18-logo.png", "https://images.cnbctv18.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/stb-18.png?impolicy=website&width=100&height=41", "https://images.cnbctv18.com/uploads/2024/08/ambuja-cements-2024-08-00fa1f1049798052efb0ef7c69d5e5df.jpg?im=FitAndFill,width=500,height=300", "https://images.cnbctv18.com/uploads/2024/08/ambuja-cements-2024-08-00fa1f1049798052efb0ef7c69d5e5df.jpg?impolicy=website&width=640&height=360"], "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "keywords": "Ambuja Cements Q2 result, ambuja cement results, ambuja cement q2 earnings, ambuja cement results today, ambuja cement q2 revenue, ambuja cement q2 profit, ambuja cement results,", "news_keywords": "Ambuja Cements Q2 result, ambuja cement results, ambuja cement q2 earnings, ambuja cement results today, ambuja cement q2 revenue, ambuja cement q2 profit, ambuja cement results,", "description": "Ambuja Cements Q2 result: The cement maker’s revenue rose 6% to ₹4,213 crore in the second quarter of FY25 from ₹3969 crore in the corresponding in the previous fiscal.

In the recent second quarter, Ambuja signed an agreement with Orient Cements to acquire 46.8% equity in the company.\"As both the companies are under the same line of business, this amalgamation will enable us to absorb the business of Sanghi Industries completely for carrying on more effectively and beneficially,\" Ambuja said in a filing.Aimed at enhancing shareholder value, this consolidation is likely to help to streamline the organisation structure and simplify compliance requirements for effective governance.Sanghi Industries has a clinker capacity of 6.6 MTPA, cement capacity of 6.1 MTPA, and limestone reserves of 1 billion tonnes. Its Sanghipuram plant is India’s largest single-location cement and clinker unit by capacity, with a captive jetty and captive power plant.Unified cash flow management post the merger is expected to pool resources for Ambuja for faster expansion and cost savings in administration and governance, thereby simplifying compliance requirements.Ambuja Cements, the country’s second-largest producer of cement, has an annual production capacity of 89 million tonnes, which it is planning to increase to 140 million tonnes by 2027-28.: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

The current market price of Ambuja Cements is Rs 533.9. Ambuja Cements Ltd ., incorporated in 1981, is a Large Cap company with a market cap of Rs 130915.01 crore, operating in the Cement sector.Ambuja Cements' key Products/Revenue Segments include Cement, Other Operating Revenue and Scrap for the year ending 31-Dec-2021.For the quarter ended 30-09-2024, the company has reported a Consolidated Total Income of Rs 7890.14 crore, down -8.96% from last quarter Total Income of Rs 8666.20 crore and down -.12% from last year same quarter Total Income of Rs 7899.99 crore. The company has reported net profit after tax of Rs 470.67 crore in latest quarter.Ambuja Cement has a net cash balance of Rs 101.4 billion as of Sep-24. Considering cash outflow of INR59b for the acquisition of Orient Cement (including proposed open offer), ACEM is estimated to remain a net cash positive company. Motilal Oswal Financial Services estimates the company to generate sufficient operating cash flows to fund its future organic expansions. 1HFY25 was a challenging period due to a demand slowdown and persistent pricing pressure. However, pent-up demand, a pick-up in construction activities, and infrastructure projects after the festive period should lead to demand recovery going forward. Further, strong demand is estimated to drive price growth for the industry. The brokerage believes Ambuja Cement, with a pan-India presence, should benefit from a recovery in cement demand, prices and cost-saving initiatives. The stock is trading attractively at 16x/13x FY26E/FY27E EV/EBITDA and $140 /$130 EV/t. The brokerage values Ambuja Cement at 20.0x Sep?26E EV/EBITDA to arrive at the target price of Rs 710.

In the recent second quarter, Ambuja signed an agreement with Orient Cements to acquire 46.8% equity in the company.Ambuja Cement is the promoter of the Sanghi Industries and holds 58.08% of equity.\"As both the companies are under the same line of business, this amalgamation will enable us to absorb the business of Sanghi Industries completely for carrying on more effectively and beneficially,\" Ambuja said in a filing.Aimed at enhancing shareholder value, this consolidation is likely to help to streamline the organisation structure and simplify compliance requirements for effective governance.Sanghi Industries has a clinker capacity of 6.6 MTPA, cement capacity of 6.1 MTPA, and limestone reserves of 1 billion tonnes. Its Sanghipuram plant is India’s largest single-location cement and clinker unit by capacity, with a captive jetty and captive power plant.Meanwhile, Penna Cement has four integrated plants in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, along with a grinding unit in Maharashtra. It has an operational capacity of 10 MTPA.Additionally, two plants, with a capacity of 2 MTPA each, are under construction in Krishnapatnam and Jodhpur, and are expected to be completed within next 8-12 months. It also has five bulk cement terminals at Kolkata, Gopalpur, Karaikal, Kochi, and Colombo (Sri Lanka).\"This merger aims to make our company more competitive and efficient, ultimately enhancing shareholder value. Enhanced working capital management and internal funds will support the growth of our business operations,\" said Ajay Kapur, CEO – Cement Business, Adani Group Unified cash flow management post the merger is expected to pool resources for Ambuja for faster expansion and cost savings in administration and governance, thereby simplifying compliance requirements.Ambuja Cements, the country’s second-largest producer of cement, has an annual production capacity of 89 million tonnes, which it is planning to increase to 140 million tonnes by 2027-28.On Tuesday, Ambuja Cements shares fell

They will transition from holding shares in a small-cap, less liquid company to owning shares in Ambuja Cement, a large-cap and market leader.According to Investec Bank plc (UK), under the terms of the merger, Sanghi Industries shareholders will receive 12 shares of Ambuja Cement (face value Rs 2 each) for every 100 shares of SIL (face value Rs 10 each).This transaction will lead to Ambuja issuing 13 million new shares, resulting in a minimal dilution of the promoter stake by 0.35 per cent.In addition, Ambuja Cement has acquired a 100 per cent stake in Penna Cement for an enterprise value of Rs 104.2 billion, to be paid in cash.This acquisition will significantly boost Ambuja's coastal market presence and production capacity, consolidating its position as an industry leader.The restructuring also includes the consolidation of AdCementation. Ambuja Cement will issue 174 shares for every 1 share of Adani Cementation, further streamlining its organizational structure.This transaction will result in the issuance of 8.7 million shares, diluting the promoter stake by an additional 0.24 per cent.These strategic moves promise to streamline operations, simplify compliance requirements, and eliminate complexities related to related party transactions (RPTs).The management has reaffirmed its focus on achieving growth, cost efficiencies, and synergy targets while maintaining its commitment to sustainability and ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) principles.The mergers are subject to regulatory approvals, including clearances from stakeholders and statutory authorities, and are expected to be completed within 9-12 months.Upon completion, the equity dilution for Ambuja Cement shareholders is estimated at 0.88 per cent, ensuring minimal impact while unlocking significant value.", "source_link":

It was formed following a complaint lodged in September 2024 by Kashmir Thakur, a resident of Khetad village near Barmana who alleged severe air pollution caused by the plant’s operations.\n\nThe tribunal was informed that the cement plant had been shut down for annual maintenance from January 3 to February 8, 2025. When the committee visited the plant on January 18, only one kiln was operating, that too at 40 per cent capacity. Acknowledging the need for a more thorough investigation under full-capacity operations, the committee requested an additional eight weeks to submit its final report.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nIn its report, the committee stated, “The plant was directed to implement measures to control accidental discharge of pollutants, especially dust emissions during grid failures. However, the plant had yet to implement these measures. Dust emissions were observed in areas around the clinker, ash, and cement silos, causing distress to nearby residents.\n\n“The consent to operate mandated the plant to establish a three-layer tree plantation along its boundary to mitigate air and noise pollution, but this critical step remained unfulfilled. Furthermore, while the plant had installed a truck tyre washing system at the raw material exit, there was no mechanism to remove oil and grease from the recycled wastewater. Additionally, the plant was still in the process of installing a tyre-washing system at the cement exit point to prevent dust from being carried outside the premises.”\n\nIn December 2024, the tribunal directed the committee to review the status of its earlier judgment—issued in December 2015—wherein an environmental compensation of Rs 50 lakh had been imposed on the ACC cement plant. The committee stated that it was in the process of examining documents submitted by the plant regarding this issue.\n\nIn his complaint, Kashmir Thakur alleged that ACC Limited has been manufacturing cement for several years, but the plant’s dust separation system was either improperly functioning or inadequately installed. As a result, flying dust generated during cement production has been accumulating on pathways, roads, and residential areas, significantly affecting nearby residents. He further said the plant has failed to effectively manage and control fugitive (unintentional) emissions.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nComplainant suspicious\n\nWhen contacted, Thakur raised doubts as to how the plant could be shut for maintenance days before the inspection of the joint committee. He said, “We believe that authorities are merely buying time. We want the inspection of the cement plant by independent experts. We will raise our demand during the next date of hearing on February 25.”\n\nCement manufacturing at the ACC Limited plant involves grinding and blending raw materials containing calcium oxide (such as limestone) with a siliceous material (such as clay, shale, and sand) along with certain additive or corrective materials (such as alumina and iron ore) and then burning the mixture at high temperatures in a kiln.\n\nThe resulting ‘clinker’ is cooled and then ground with gypsum to produce the finished product, ordinary portland cement, or with pozzolanic material like fly ash to produce blended cement. The major raw materials used in the manufacture of cement are limestone, gypsum, and fly ash, while coal is used as fuel in the kilns.\n\nThe major raw materials used in the manufacture of cement are limestone, gypsum, fly ash, and coal, which is used as fuel in the kilns. The limestone for the existing plant is obtained from a captive limestone mine located about 4.0 km (by road) from the cement plant. The crushed limestone from the mine is transported through a land-enclosed belt conveyor to the cement plant. The raw material is processed in a cement kiln to make the clinker. The kiln is fitted with a suspension preheater system to reuse the heat from the flue gases.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nThe unit operates on a dry process and also uses waste heat from the cement kilns to dry the raw material. The remaining waste heat, if any, is used to generate power by deploying a waste heat recovery system. Gypsum and fly ash are ground in the cement mill in required proportions to produce cement. The cement thus produced is stored in silos and sent to the packing plant, where it is packed through packing machines and dispatched.", "source_link":

The panel will have to submit a factual report to the tribunal.The committee members include officials from the Himachal Pradesh State Pollution Control Board (HPSPCB) and Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) along with the Bilaspur deputy commissioner. The NGT appointed the CPCB as the nodal authority for coordination and compliance of its order.The NGT order came on a letter petition filed by Kashmir Thakur, a resident of Barmana village, who stated that flying dust from the factory during cement production process settles on pathways, concrete roads, and residential accommodations in the area.The petition added that ACC Limited has been manufacturing cement for the last several years but has not been able to manage and control dust emission from its plant effectively. \"The dust separation system is not properly functioning or has not been properly erected by the proponent, due to which it has not been able to control fugitive emissions,\" according to the petition.Reacting to the points raised in the petition, the NGT observed that \"before taking any action, we find it appropriate to obtain a factual report by constituting a joint committee.\"The NGT in 2015 imposed an environmental penalty of Rs 50 lakh against ACC Ltd for causing air pollution and thereby a health hazard in Barmana. The penalty amount was meant to be used for healing the environmental damage caused in the area and to ensure there is no pollution in the future.ACC Limited, along with Ambuja Cements, was taken over by the Adani Group from Holcim Group, a Swiss company, in May 2022.", "source_link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/ngt-forms-joint-panel-to-investigate-air-pollution-plaint-against-adani-owned-cement-plant-in-hp/articleshow/117993171.cms", "keywords": ["Chandigarh news", "Chandigarh latest news", "Chandigarh news live", "Chandigarh news today", "Today news Chandigarh", "NGT investigation air pollution", "Himachal Pradesh air pollution", "Barmana village environmental concerns", "Adani Group cement plant complaint", "ACC cement plant issues"], "tags": [], "article_images": "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117993170,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-19160,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg", "all_images": ["https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117993170,imgsize-19160,width-400,height-225,resizemode-72/117993170.jpg", "https://static.toiimg.com/photo/92222747.cms", "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117993170,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-19160,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg", "https://static.toiimg.com/photo/83033472.cms", "https://static.toiimg.com/photo/87458172.cms", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=593671331875494&ev=PageView&noscript=1"], "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "Kullu: Taking cognizance of a complaint that has accused Adani Group-owned ACC cement plant in Barmana village of Himachal Pradesh's Bilaspur district.", "keywords": "Chandigarh news, Chandigarh latest news, Chandigarh news live, Chandigarh news today, Today news Chandigarh,NGT investigation air pollution,Himachal Pradesh air pollution,Barmana village environmental concerns,Adani Group cement plant complaint,ACC cement plant issues", "robots": "NOODP", "og": {"title": "NGT forms joint panel to investigate air pollution plaint against Adani-owned cement plant in HP | Chandigarh News - The Times of India", "url": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/ngt-forms-joint-panel-to-investigate-air-pollution-plaint-against-adani-owned-cement-plant-in-hp/articleshow/117993171.cms", "image": {"identifier": "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117993170,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-19160,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg", "width": 1070, "height": 580}, "description": "Kullu: Taking cognizance of a complaint that has accused Adani Group-owned ACC cement plant in Barmana village of Himachal Pradesh's Bilaspur district.", "site_name": "The Times of India", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"url": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/ngt-forms-joint-panel-to-investigate-air-pollution-plaint-against-adani-owned-cement-plant-in-hp/articleshow/117993171.cms", "image": "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-117993170,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-19160,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg", "title": "NGT forms joint panel to investigate air pollution plaint against Adani-owned cement plant in HP | Chandigarh News - The Times of India", "description": "Kullu: Taking cognizance of a complaint that has accused Adani Group-owned ACC cement plant in Barmana village of Himachal Pradesh's Bilaspur district.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@timesofindia"}, "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "news_keywords": "NGT investigation air pollution,Himachal Pradesh air pollution,Barmana village environmental concerns,Adani Group cement plant complaint,ACC cement plant issues", "expires": "2045-02-07T00:35:00+05:30", "The Times of India": "app-id=427589329,app-argument=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/ngt-forms-joint-panel-to-investigate-air-pollution-plaint-against-adani-owned-cement-plant-in-hp/articleshow/117993171.cms", "y_key": "b1abb36a8d5c19c9", "theme-color": "#af2c2c", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "MobileOptimized": "width", "fb": {"pages": 227797153941209, "app_id": 117787264903013}, "google-site-verification": "GdaeWTVPddYtkw-2hEyDpLYMw9SjsNr4dS5Z-9tfcT0"}, "ambuja_kawach_count": 0, "ambuja_cool_walls_count": 0, "ambuja_compocem_count": 0, "ultratech_weather_pro_flex_count": 0, "shree_aac_blocks_count": 0, "ambuja_plus_count": 0, "ultratech_flex_count": 0, "shree_adhesives_count": 0},

Learn more about its growth.", "article_body": "ACC Limited, a key cement and building materials company under the Adani Group, has reported a massive jump in its net profit, with the latter rising by a whopping 103% year-on-year to ₹1,092 crore in Q3 FY25. This is more than double of what it saw in the corresponding quarter last year, which was at ₹538 crore.\n\nThe cement maker, considered India's second-largest, also said that its consolidated revenue from operations rose marginally by 7.25 per cent at ₹5,207.29 crore from ₹4,855.22 crore YoY. Sequentially, revenue grew by 15% from Rs 4,521.29 crore.\n\nThis performance, according to the company, was driven by a 21% YoY rise in cement and clinker sales volumes, reaching 10.7 million tonnes, the highest for any quarter in the company’s history.\n\nAjay Kapur, Whole Time Director and CEO, attributed the robust results to strategic cost optimisation, efficiency enhancements, and growing demand for premium cement products. “Our Q3 results demonstrate our focus on driving growth through higher volumes, cost efficiencies, and innovation. We remain committed to sustainability and maximising stakeholder value,” Kapur said.\n\nOperating EBITDA increased to ₹1,116 crore, with margins improving slightly to 18.8% from 18.4% last year.\n\nAccording to the company, cost efficiencies were a key driver of this growth. ACC, which is regarded as the second-largest cement maker in India, reduced kiln fuel costs by 10% and logistics expenses by 9% year-on-year, while optimising its fuel basket with low-cost imported petcoke and leveraging synergies with Adani Group companies. Additionally, green power usage increased to 18.7% of total power consumption, reflecting ACC’s commitment to sustainability.\n\nFor the nine-month period ending December 31, 2024, the company recorded a revenue of ₹15,696 crore, a 7.9% increase from the previous year, with cumulative sales volumes rising 15% to 30.3 million tonnes.\n\nLooking ahead, ACC expects cement demand to rebound in Q4 FY25, supported by infrastructure and housing sector growth spurred by increased government spending. Cement demand for FY25 is projected to grow by 4-5%.", "source_link": "https://www.fortuneindia.com/macro/adani-groups-cement-maker-acc-sees-massive-103-surge-in-profit-driven-by-record-sales/120174", "keywords": ["acc", "acc cements", "adani acc cements", "adani ambuja acc cements", "acc limited profit surge", "adani group cement", "q3 fy25 results", "cement sales growth", "acc net profit growth", "acc revenue increase", "acc cement performance", "acc q3 fy25"], "tags": ["ACC", "India's Richest"], "article_images": "https://media.assettype.com/fortuneindia/2022-04/b04f469c-4134-431b-9f4b-80698d8d3183/cement.jpg?w=700", "all_images": ["https://images.assettype.com/fortuneindia/2025-02-12/ochbp85n/Capture.avif?w=100&q=95", "https://images.assettype.com/fortuneindia/2022-03/84bee52b-62f9-48f5-b6f2-bc8dd1d978d2/Nirmala_Sitharaman.jpg?rect=0,58,2047,1151&w=100&q=95", "https://media.assettype.com/fortuneindia/2022-04/b04f469c-4134-431b-9f4b-80698d8d3183/cement.jpg?w=700", "https://images.assettype.com/fortuneindia/2025-01-25/n97itffv/Religare.jpg?w=100&q=95", "https://images.assettype.com/fortuneindia/2025-02-12/b1aqlc0e/Ramdeo-2.jpg?w=100&q=95", "https://images.assettype.com/fortuneindia/2021-12/e78d5cab-0f50-46e4-93d5-0f4b5178927c/Piyush_Goyal_01865_copy.jpg?rect=0,0,2700,1519&w=100&q=95", "https://images.assettype.com/fortuneindia/2022-04/b04f469c-4134-431b-9f4b-80698d8d3183/cement.jpg?w=480&h=270&q=60&fit=cover"], "article_metadata": {"title": "Adani Group's cement maker ACC reports 103% profit surge in Q3 FY25, driven by record sales | Fortune India", "description": "ACC Limited, part of Adani Group, reports a 103% rise in net profit for Q3 FY25, driven by record sales and cost efficiencies.

Adani Family Trust owns 57% of the company\n\n\n\nIf you want to know who really controls ACC Limited ( ), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are private companies with 57% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).\n\nWhile institutions who own 26% came under pressure after market cap dropped to ₹448b last week,private companies took the most losses.\n\nLet's delve deeper into each type of owner of ACC, beginning with the chart below.\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About ACC?\n\nInstitutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.\n\nWe can see that ACC does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at ACC's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.\n\nACC is not owned by hedge funds. S.B. Adani Family Trust is currently the largest shareholder, with 57% of shares outstanding. With such a huge stake in the ownership, we infer that they have significant control of the future of the company. With 6.4% and 3.3% of the shares outstanding respectively, Life Insurance Corporation of India, Asset Management Arm and HDFC Asset Management Company Limited are the second and third largest shareholders.\n\nWhile it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.\n\nInsider Ownership Of ACC\n\nWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.\n\nInsider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.\n\nWe note our data does not show any board members holding shares, personally. It is unusual not to have at least some personal holdings by board members, so our data might be flawed. A good next step would be to\n\nGeneral Public Ownership\n\nThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 16% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.\n\nPrivate Company Ownership\n\nOur data indicates that Private Companies hold 57%, of the company's shares. It might be worth looking deeper into this. If related parties, such as insiders, have an interest in one of these private companies, that should be disclosed in the annual report. Private companies may also have a strategic interest in the company.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nWhile it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. For instance, we've identified that you should be aware of.\n\nIf you would prefer discover what analysts are predicting in terms of future growth, do not miss this free .\n\nNB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

However, stock prices are...", "article_body": "With its stock down 7.0% over the past three months, it is easy to disregard ACC (NSE:ACC). However, stock prices are usually driven by a company’s financials over the long term, which in this case look pretty respectable. In this article, we decided to focus on ROE.\n\nReturn on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital.\n\nHow Is ROE Calculated?\n\nThe formula for ROE is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for ACC is:\n\n12% = ₹20b ÷ ₹167b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2024).\n\nThe 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every ₹1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn ₹0.12 in profit.\n\nWhat Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?\n\nWe have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or \"retains\", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.\n\nACC's Earnings Growth And 12% ROE\n\nOn the face of it, ACC's ROE is not much to talk about. Although a closer study shows that the company's ROE is higher than the industry average of 6.5% which we definitely can't overlook. Having said that, ACC's net income growth over the past five years is more or less flat. Remember, the company's ROE is a bit low to begin with, just that it is higher than the industry average. Hence, this goes some way in explaining the flat earnings growth.\n\nWe then compared ACC's net income growth with the industry and found that the company's growth figure is lower than the average industry growth rate of 5.5% in the same 5-year period, which is a bit concerning.\n\nThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Is ACC fairly valued? This has everything you need to know.\n\nIs ACC Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?\n\nIn spite of a normal three-year median payout ratio of 28% (or a retention ratio of 72%), ACC hasn't seen much growth in its earnings. So there could be some other explanation in that regard. For instance, the company's business may be deteriorating.\n\nIn addition, ACC has been paying dividends over a period of at least ten years suggesting that keeping up dividend payments is way more important to the management even if it comes at the cost of business growth. Existing analyst estimates suggest that the company's future payout ratio is expected to drop to 14% over the next three years. However, the company's ROE is not expected to change by much despite the lower expected payout ratio.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn total, it does look like ACC has some positive aspects to its business. Although, we are disappointed to see a lack of growth in earnings even in spite of a moderate ROE and and a high reinvestment rate. We believe that there might be some outside factors that could be having a negative impact on the business. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings are expected to accelerate. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?\n\nNew: Manage All Your Stock Portfolios in One Place We've created the ultimate portfolio companion for stock investors, and it's free. • Connect an unlimited number of Portfolios and see your total in one currency\n\n• Be alerted to new Warning Signs or Risks via email or mobile\n\n• Track the Fair Value of your stocks\n\nTry a Demo Portfolio for Free\n\nHave feedback on this article?

The cement company further noted in its Q2 exchange filing that government focus on infrastructure development will continue to be a key demand driver for the industry.The Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Rural & Urban), especially, is expected to contribute to higher demand in cement through its sanction for houses.\"Government’s continued focus on infrastructure development - roads, highways, railways, and metros – will continue to remain as the key demand driver. Sanction of additional houses under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Rural & Urban) along with increase in industrial and commercial capex is expected to meaningfully create future cement demand. We expect cement demand to register growth of 4-5% during FY 2025,\" the Adani Group company said.ACC Ltd reported a 48 per cent year-on-year (YoY) decline in consolidated net profit , totalling Rs 200 crore for the second quarter, down from Rs 388 crore in the same period last year. However, revenue from operations rose by 4 per cent YoY to Rs 4,614 crore.This revenue growth marks the highest increase in the second quarter over the past five years, driven by higher trade sales volume and an increase in premium products, which accounted for 36 per cent of trade sales.In terms of operational performance, sales volume for clinker and cement grew by 15 per cent YoY, reaching 9.3 million tons, bolstered by rising trade volumes and greater premium product sales.Additionally, an optimised fuel mix, enhanced supply chain linkages, and increased captive coal consumption led to a 15% reduction in kiln fuel costs.Sharekhan had earlier estimated ACC’s net sales figures at Rs 4,263 crore, which could go up by 4% on a YoY basis and 17.3 per cent on a QoQ basis.

Companies like Adani Group of companies like ACC Ltd, Ambuja Cements Ltd and UltraTech Cement Ltd have the ability to drive the price and logistics on the supply side of the activity.\"\n\nThose who are expanding their footprints can be relatively better choices subsequently, which is the likes of Shree Cement Ltd, Choksey suggested. \"The structural change is in the area of increment in the margin. Given that direction and strong demand scenario, the larger capacity companies would be a better choice to add to a portfolio,\" he added.\n\nIn response to a query on metals, the market specialist said the tailwind is extremely favourable for Vedanta Ltd. \"The structural changes such as demerging companies and deleveraging balance sheets and the company will start this entire outcome playing out well somewhere around the first quarter of the next financial year 2025-26 (FY26). If one is taking a position six months ahead of such an event, this is the right time to possibly bet on Vedanta. Having said that, the commodity prices are remaining very stable,\" DRChoksey explained.\n\nFrom the energy place, the market expert liked Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL). \"Reliance is playing out very well on the oil-to-chemical business despite of adversities everywhere, he said.\n\nMeanwhile, Indian equity benchmarks recorded a sharp fall today due to weakness across all sectors.

The profit after tax (PAT) was lower than the CNBC-TV18 poll estimate of ₹209 crore.The cement maker saw a 4% year-on-year growth in its revenue to ₹4,614 crore, which the statement said is the highest quarterly revenue and also beat the projection of ₹4,614 crore.ACC saw a volume growth of 15% year-on-year at 9.3 million tonnes, it said in a statement, adding that this is the highest volume in the Q2 series in the last five years.The increase in volume was supported by an increase in trade volumes and higher premium product volumes (14% YoY), ensuring market leadership, the statement added.The firm’s operating EBITDA or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation for the quarter under review fell more than 20% YoY to ₹436 crore whereas the margin for Q2 stood at 9.5%, which is a 290 basis points drop from 12.4% in the same quarter of last year.The Adani group firm’s cash and cash equivalent for the September 2024 quarter stood at ₹2,921 crore, with a net worth of ₹16,725 crore. The EPS diluted to ₹10.5 during the quarter, the statement said.Reflecting on the outlook, ACC said, the industry overall expects an improvement in demand in the second half of 2024-25, which is likely to be driven by post-monsoon pickup in construction and housing activity.“Government’s continued focus on infrastructure development - roads, highways, railways, and metros – will continue to remain as the key demand driver. Sanction of additional houses under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Rural and Urban) along with an increase in industrial and commercial capex is expected to meaningfully create future cement demand. We expect cement demand to register growth of 4-5% during FY25,” the company said in its earnings statement.Following the Q2 results, ACC shares traded nearly a percent lower at ₹2,236.25 on NSE at 1:56 pm.", "source_link": "https://www.cnbctv18.com/market/earnings/acc-q2-results-profit-margin-decline-revenue-and-volume-increase-volumes-grow-15-percent-19498370.htm", "keywords": ["acc", "acc result", "acc q2 result", "acc q2 results", "acc shares", "acc share price", ""], "tags": ["Featured"], "article_images": "https://images.cnbctv18.com/uploads/2021/08/cement.jpg?im=FitAndFill,width=500,height=300", "all_images": ["https://www.cnbctv18.com/static/images/CNBC-TV18-logo-black.png", "https://images.cnbctv18.com/uploads/2021/08/cement.jpg?impolicy=website&width=640&height=360", "https://images.cnbctv18.com/uploads/2024/10/acc-q2-2024-10-2af032d4fe937df213f9affab80fd0a8.jpeg?im=Resize,width=360,aspect=fit,type=normal", "https://www.cnbctv18.com/static/images/author.png", "https://www.cnbctv18.com/static/images/bingelogo/binge-logo.png?impolicy=website&width=110&height=33", "https://www.cnbctv18.com/static/images/awaz-black.png", "https://www.cnbctv18.com/static/images/CNBC_Bajar.png", "https://images.cnbctv18.com/uploads/2024/10/acc-q2-poll-2024-10-2d006549935a7defd038b51eee196ea4.jpeg?im=Resize,width=360,aspect=fit,type=normal", "https://www.cnbctv18.com/_next/static/media/gplay_1.fee9ff82.svg", "https://www.cnbctv18.com/static/images/common/cnbctv18-logo.png", "https://images.cnbctv18.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/stb-18.png?impolicy=website&width=100&height=41", "https://images.cnbctv18.com/uploads/2021/08/cement.jpg?im=FitAndFill,width=500,height=300"], "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "keywords": "acc, acc result, acc q2 result, acc q2 results, acc shares, acc share price,", "news_keywords": "acc, acc result, acc q2 result, acc q2 results, acc shares, acc share price,", "description": "ACC Q2 results: Apart from revenue that rose 4% year-on-year, the cement maker saw a decline in earnings across parameters inlcuding profit, operating EBITDA and margin.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"title": "ACC Q2 results: Profit almost halves to ₹199 crore, volumes grow 15% - CNBC TV18", "description": "ACC Q2 results: Apart from revenue that rose 4% year-on-year, the cement maker saw a decline in earnings across parameters inlcuding profit, operating EBITDA and margin.", "image": {"identifier": "https://images.cnbctv18.com/uploads/2021/08/cement.jpg?im=FitAndFill,width=500,height=300", "width": 500, "height": 300, "alt": "ACC Q2 results: Profit almost halves to ₹199 crore, volumes grow 15% - CNBC TV18"}, "url": "https://www.cnbctv18.com/market/earnings/acc-q2-results-profit-margin-decline-revenue-and-volume-increase-volumes-grow-15-percent-19498370.htm", "type": "article", "site_name": "CNBCTV18", "locale": "en_US", "published_time": "2024-10-24T14:09:38+05:30"}, "fb": {"app_id": 156376409143552}, "twitter": {"title": "ACC Q2 results: Profit almost halves to ₹199 crore, volumes grow 15% - CNBC TV18", "description": "ACC Q2 results: Apart from revenue that rose 4% year-on-year, the cement maker saw a decline in earnings across parameters inlcuding profit, operating EBITDA and margin.", "url": "https://www.cnbctv18.com/market/earnings/acc-q2-results-profit-margin-decline-revenue-and-volume-increase-volumes-grow-15-percent-19498370.htm", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": {"identifier": "https://images.cnbctv18.com/uploads/2021/08/cement.jpg?im=FitAndFill,width=500,height=300", "alt": "ACC Q2 results: Profit almost halves to ₹199 crore, volumes grow 15% - CNBC TV18"}, "site": "@CNBCTV18Live", "creator": "@CNBCTV18Live"}, "article": {"published_time": "2024-10-24T14:09:38+05:30", "modified_time": "2024-10-24T14:25:55+05:30"}, "next-head-count": 32, "google-site-verification": "q69AOLOJd1YyUhPzt30m60oh04vQGCci_t1oNuqmdOE"}, "ambuja_kawach_count": 0, "ambuja_cool_walls_count": 0, "ambuja_compocem_count": 0, "ultratech_weather_pro_flex_count": 0, "shree_aac_blocks_count": 0, "ambuja_plus_count": 0, "ultratech_flex_count": 0, "shree_adhesives_count": 0},

Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!\n\nWe generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model.\n\nStep By Step Through The Calculation\n\nWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\n\nA DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:\n\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast\n\n2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 2034 Levered FCF (₹, Millions) ₹5.75b ₹12.2b ₹20.9b ₹28.5b ₹36.2b ₹43.9b ₹51.3b ₹58.3b ₹65.1b ₹71.7b Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x4 Analyst x6 Analyst x4 Est @ 36.06% Est @ 27.26% Est @ 21.09% Est @ 16.78% Est @ 13.76% Est @ 11.64% Est @ 10.16% Present Value (₹, Millions) Discounted @ 13% ₹5.1k ₹9.5k ₹14.4k ₹17.2k ₹19.3k ₹20.6k ₹21.3k ₹21.3k ₹21.0k ₹20.4k\n\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\n\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = ₹170b\n\nAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 6.7%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 13%.\n\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF 2034 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = ₹72b× (1 + 6.7%) ÷ (13%– 6.7%) = ₹1.1t\n\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= ₹1.1t÷ ( 1 + 13%)10= ₹326b\n\nThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is ₹496b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of ₹2.2k, the company appears about fair value at a 17% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.\n\nThe Assumptions\n\nNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at ACC as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 13%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.982. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\n\nSWOT Analysis for ACC\n\nStrength Earnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry. Currently debt free. Weakness Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Basic Materials market. Opportunity Annual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years. Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value. Threat Paying a dividend but company has no free cash flows. Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the Indian market.\n\nLooking Ahead:\n\nValuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result.

The committee noted the need for a more detailed investigation under full-capacity operations and requested an additional eight weeks to submit its final findings.\n\nGold Membership Join Gold Membership \"Gold Membership: Unlock exclusive benefits and premium support to elevate your experience and achieve more.\" Truth\n\nSupport\n\nImpact\n\nAction Unbiased Journalism for a Better Tomorrow We strive to bring you in-depth, unbiased journalism that uncovers hidden truths and amplifies diverse voices.

It noted that despite previous directions to implement measures to control accidental pollutant discharge, especially during grid failures, the plant had not acted upon these recommendations.\n\nLong-Standing compliance issues\n\nThe report further highlighted non-compliance with the consent to operate conditions, including the failure to establish a three-layer tree plantation to mitigate air and noise pollution. The truck tyre washing system installed at the raw material exit point lacked a mechanism to remove oil and grease from recycled wastewater. Additionally, the plant was still in the process of installing a tyre washing system at the cement exit point, necessary to prevent the spread of dust outside its premises.\n\nIn December 2024, the NGT directed the committee to review the implementation of its 2015 judgment, wherein an environmental compensation of ₹50 lakh had been imposed on the plant. The committee noted that it was still examining the documents submitted by the plant regarding compliance with that judgment.\n\nResident complaint\n\nThe investigation followed a complaint lodged by Kashmir Thakur, a resident of Khetad village near Barmana, in September 2024. Thakur alleged that the plant’s dust separation system was either improperly installed or malfunctioning, leading to the accumulation of cement dust on roads, pathways, and residential areas. This, he claimed, had caused severe health and environmental issues for residents.\n\nThakur also alleged that the plant failed to effectively control fugitive emissions, further aggravating the environmental impact in the region.\n\nThe tribunal will consider the committee’s preliminary findings and pending compliance issues at the next hearing.", "source_link": "https://himachalscape.com/ngt-committee-flags-environmental-lapses-at-acc-cement-plant-in-himachal-pradesh/", "keywords": [""], "tags": [], "article_images": "https://himachalscape.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/ACC-cement.jpg", "all_images": ["https://himachalscape.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/MC-Shimla-150x150.jpg", "https://himachalscape.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/ACC-cement.jpg", "http://himachalscape.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/4.png", "http://himachalscape.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/newsletter.webp", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAP///wAAACH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==", "http://himachalscape.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Himachal-Scape.png", "http://himachalscape.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/HimachalScape-ad-1-contribu.gif", "https://foxiz.themeruby.com/default/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/09/login.png", "http://himachalscape.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/1.png", "http://himachalscape.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Himachal-Scape-1.png", "http://himachalscape.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/3.png", "https://himachalscape.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Carbon-credit-150x150.jpg", "http://himachalscape.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/2.png", "http://himachalscape.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Logo-final-for-whatts-app.gif", "http://himachalscape.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Shimla-lights-ad-web.gif"], "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "Elementor 3.27.3; features: e_font_icon_svg, additional_custom_breakpoints; settings: css_print_method-external, google_font-enabled, font_display-swap", "google-adsense-platform-account": "ca-host-pub-2644536267352236", "google-adsense-platform-domain": "sitekit.withgoogle.com", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "NGT Committee flags environmental lapses at ACC Cement Plant in Himachal Pradesh", "url": "https://himachalscape.com/ngt-committee-flags-environmental-lapses-at-acc-cement-plant-in-himachal-pradesh/", "description": "Shimla, Jan 28, A joint committee constituted by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) has identified significant violations of environmental regulations at the ACC Limited cement plant, owned by the A…", "site_name": "Himachal Scape", "image": {"identifier": "https://himachalscape.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/ACC-cement.jpg", "width": 648, "height": 362}, "locale": "en_GB"}, "article": {"published_time": "2025-01-28T09:10:05+00:00", "modified_time": "2025-01-28T09:10:05+00:00"}, "twitter": {"text": {"title": "NGT Committee flags environmental lapses at ACC Cement Plant in Himachal Pradesh"}, "image": "https://himachalscape.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/ACC-cement.jpg?w=640", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://himachalscape.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Logo-HS-for-website-300x300.jpg", "position": 4, "url": "https://himachalscape.com/ngt-committee-flags-environmental-lapses-at-acc-cement-plant-in-himachal-pradesh/"}, "ambuja_kawach_count": 0, "ambuja_cool_walls_count": 0, "ambuja_compocem_count": 0, "ultratech_weather_pro_flex_count": 0, "shree_aac_blocks_count": 0, "ambuja_plus_count": 0, "ultratech_flex_count": 0, "shree_adhesives_count": 0},

The company had posted a profit of Rs 537.67 crore in the October-December quarter a year ago, according to a regulatory filing from ACC, now a part of Adani Cement.Its revenue from operations was at Rs 5,207.3 crore during the quarter under review. It was at Rs 4,855.22 crore in the corresponding period a year ago.ACC's results are not comparable as it had acquired the remaining 55 per cent of the Asian Concretes and Cements (ACCPL) along with its step-down wholly-owned subsidiary Asian Fine Cements. The consolidated financial results for the current quarter include the consolidated financial results of ACCPL.\"Accordingly, the consolidated financial results for the quarter and nine months ended December 31, 2024, are not comparable with quarter and nine months ended December 31, 2023, to that extent,\" it said.During the quarter, ACC received a refund of Rs 720.09 crore from the government as an incentive in the form of exemption of excise duty on captive consumption of clinker for the period from May 2005 to February 2013.Earlier the excise authorities, in Shimla had denied the above exemption, however, the Customs, Excise and Service Tax Appellate Tribunal ruled in ACC's holding company's favour.Based on the refund order Rs 636.86 crore is recognised as income during the quarter and nine months ended December 31, 2024, it added.ACC's total expenses in the December quarter were at Rs 5,099.44 crore.The total income of ACC in the December quarter was Rs 6,575.62 crore. Its revenue from the Cement business was at Rs 5,614.17 crore and Rs 344.50 crore from the Ready Mix Concrete business.\"The performance comes on the back of volume growth, cost optimisation and improved efficiency parameters,\" said ACC.Commenting over the results, Whole Time Director & CEO Ajay Kapur said Q3 results demonstrate a strategic focus on driving growth through higher volumes, cost optimisation, and enhanced efficiencies.\"With strong demand for our premium cement products and our commitment to excellence on all parameters in line with our ESG leadership, we are leveraging innovation and sustainability to maintain our competitive edge and maximise stakeholder value. We are well-poised to achieve sustained profitability and capitalise on our strategic vision set forth for our business,\" he said.Over the outlook, the company said though the cement sector experienced modest growth of 1.5-2 per cent during H1 FY25, however, it is expected to \"rebound\" in Q4 FY25 as construction activity accelerates in the infrastructure and housing segments.\"The pro-infra and housing Budget 2025, along with increased government spending on infrastructure and construction activities, is anticipated to further support this growth. Cement demand is projected to grow in the range of 4-5 per cent for FY25,\" said ACC.Shares of ACC on Monday were trading at Rs 2,036.05 a piece on the BSE, down 1.05 per cent from the previous close.>", "source_link": "https://energy.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/coal/acc-q3-net-profit-at-rs-1091-8-cr-revenue-at-rs-5207-3-cr/117604911", "keywords": ["ACC Q3 net profit 2024", "ACC Ltd financial results", "Adani Cement acquisition", "ACC revenue and profit report", "Cement industry growth FY25"], "tags": ["Infographics", "Environment", "Adani Cement acquisition", "ACC revenue and profit report", "Cement industry growth FY25", "Companies", "ACC Q3 net profit 2024", "ACC Ltd financial results", "Economy"], "article_images": "https://etimg.etb2bimg.com/thumb/msid-117604911,imgsize-3580,width-1200,height=765,overlay-etenergy/coal/acc-q3-net-profit-at-rs-1091-8-cr-revenue-at-rs-5207-3-cr.jpg", "all_images": ["https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/arrow-right.svg", "https://energy.economictimes.indiatimes.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/linkedin-share.svg", "https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/linkedin-icon.png", "https://energy.economictimes.indiatimes.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/copy-icon.svg", "https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/comment-icon.svg?mod=2839", "https://energy.economictimes.indiatimes.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/telegram-share.svg", "https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/et-icon.svg", "https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/icon-newsletter.svg", "https://etimg.etb2bimg.com/thumb/msid-117604911,imgsize-3580,width-1200,height=765,overlay-etenergy/coal/acc-q3-net-profit-at-rs-1091-8-cr-revenue-at-rs-5207-3-cr.jpg", "https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/bookmarked-icon.svg", "https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/icon-search.svg", "https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/bookmark-icon-grey.svg?mod=2", "https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/twitter-icon.png", "https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/icon-g-play.png", "https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/app-store-icon.png", "https://img.etb2bimg.com/files/cp/upload-1716881890-etenergyworld.webp", "https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/icon-home.svg", "https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/bar-codes/energy_barcode.png?mod=2839", "https://energy.economictimes.indiatimes.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/facebook-share.svg", "https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/logos/energy-logo-mobile-header.svg?mod=2839", "https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/logos/energy-logo-footer.svg?mod=2839", "https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/newsletter-icon.webp", "https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/logos/energy-logo-header.svg?mod=2839", "https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/gplay-icon.png", "https://energy.economictimes.indiatimes.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/twitter-share.svg", "https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/insta-icon.png", "https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/icon-app-store.png", "https://energy.economictimes.indiatimes.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/whatsapp-share.svg", "https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/icon-no-comments.svg", "https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/facebook-icon.png", "https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/icon-share-arrow.png", "https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/youtube-icon.png", "https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/icon-reader.svg"], "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "google-site-verification": "ZgFICIedNvVZl5pV9EfAUeenwta9vBY0Za_GgmV4zuw", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "author": "www.ETEnergyworld.com", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "ACC Q3 net profit at Rs 1,091.8 cr, revenue at Rs 5,207.3 cr -

It expects FY26 to be only slightly better. Consolidation of market share, capacity and resources will sustain premium valuations for the large players, it said.\n\nThe brokerage maintained its 'Buy' rating on Ultratech Cement and said it is neutral on Shree Cement, Dalmia Bharat Ltd and Ambuja Cements. The broking firm has 'Sell' rating on ACC.\n\nThe brokerage suggested a 12-month target price of Rs 12,460 for UltraTech Cement, Rs 1,985 for Dalmia Bharat, Rs 2,345 for ACC, Rs 575 for Ambuja Cements and Rs 27,670 for Shree Cement.\n\nThe brokerge has lowered its FY25-FY27 Ebitda estimates across the coverage, largely reflecting lower pricing assumption given the limited price hikes in Q3, and the supply-demand balance keeping its long-term price hike assumptions relatively muted.\n\n\"Our valuation multiples remain unchanged for all names expect Ultratech, where we lower the multiple to LT median +0.5STDEV (vs. +1STDEV previously). While we continue to believe in Ultratech’s ability to be the consolidator which should drive a valuation premium, we note that over the next 12-15 months, Shree Cement and Ambuja are adding equivalent organic capacity as Ultratech,\" it said.\n\nDespite the weak industry profitability in FY25, the magnitude of correction in cement stocks has been far less, suggesting continued multiple re-rating.\n\n\"We attribute this to the ongoing industry structure change where the large players are (1) Growing market share; (2) Investing in new capacity; (3) Investing in green energy; and (4) Creating long-term visibility through acquisition of limestone reserves and hence we expect that despite the weak near-term numbers, the\n\ncement sector - especially the large players are likely to trade at premium to their historical valuation ranges,\" it said.\n\nGoldman Sachs said with larger players adding significant capacity over the next 12-18 months, and consolidators looking to ramp up utilisations of the acquired assets, we the fight for volume share is likely to continue in Calendar 2025, which could keep pricing and therefore profitability improvement in check despite the cost tailwinds and demand pick-up.\n\n", "source_link":

In the first quarter of FY25, ACC posted a 23% year-on-year decline in net profit.", "article_body": "ACC’s shares traded muted on July 30, following the company’s quarterly results for the April to June 2024 period. In the first quarter of FY25, ACC reported a 23% year-on-year decline in net profit, which also fell short of street estimates.\n\nBrokerages on ACC Cement\n\nMorgan Stanley on ACC\n\nMorgan Stanley has issued an equal-weight call on ACC Cement with a target price of Rs 2,930. Key takeaways from Q1 include a 9% year-over-year increase in volumes (cement and clinker), which was significantly higher than the estimated 4% growth.\n\nHowever, realizations were weaker, moderating by 3.1% quarter-over-quarter compared to the forecasted 1.5% sequential moderation. Fuel costs were better than expected, but the benefits were broadly offset by higher raw materials and ‘other’ costs.\n\nJefferies on ACC\n\nJefferies has issued a buy call on ACC Cement with a target price of Rs 3,045. The report notes that Q1 earnings data showed EBITDA in line with expectations, and volumes grew 9% year-over-year, beating forecasts. However, realizations were down 3% quarter-over-quarter, compared to the estimated 2-2.5% decline.\n\nProfit after tax (PAT) stood at Rs 360 crore, lower than the estimated Rs 380 crore and down 22% year-over-year due to higher depreciation. The company’s cash position declined due to opportunistic purchases of input materials (raw materials and fuel) and capital expenditures.\n\nNomura on ACC\n\nNomura has issued a reduce rating on ACC Cement with a target price of Rs 2,200. The report highlights that Q1 showed strong volume growth, delivering a marginal beat on EBITDA. Volumes grew 9% year-over-year to 10.2 million tons, surpassing estimates by 5%.\n\nThis growth is attributed to a higher share of volumes under Master Supply Agreements (MSAs). The blended EBITDA per ton stood at Rs 664, which was in line with expectations.\n\nCLSA on ACC\n\nCLSA has maintained a hold rating on ACC Cement with a target price of Rs 2,730. The report notes that Q1 EBITDA of Rs 6.8 billion, down 12% year-over-year, was largely in line with expectations as higher volumes offset weak profitability.\n\nVolumes grew 9% year-over-year to 10.2 million tons, while realizations fell 3% quarter-over-quarter, matching estimates.\n\nACC Cement share performance in last one year\n\nThe shares of Tata Motors have demonstrated mixed returns across various time intervals. In the last month, the stock delivered a negative return of 5.79%. Over the past six months, it exhibited strong momentum with returns of 2.94%, indicating a robust performance.\n\nYear-to-date figures further emphasized the stock’s bullish trend, recording an impressive growth of 15.27%. Looking at the broader horizon, the shares have shown consistent strength, given returns of over 28.15% in the last year.\n\n(Disclaimer: Views, recommendations, and opinions expressed are personal and do not reflect the official position or policy of Financial Express.com.

Although, it's not wise to just take the P/E at face value as there may be an explanation why it's limited.\n\nWith earnings growth that's superior to most other companies of late, ACC has been doing relatively well. One possibility is that the P/E is low because investors think this strong earnings performance might be less impressive moving forward. If not, then existing shareholders have reason to be quite optimistic about the future direction of the share price.\n\nIs There Any Growth For ACC?\n\nKeen to find out how analysts think ACC's future stacks up against the industry? In that case, our .\n\nACC's P/E ratio would be typical for a company that's only expected to deliver limited growth, and importantly, perform worse than the market.\n\nRetrospectively, the last year delivered an exceptional 378% gain to the company's bottom line. Pleasingly, EPS has also lifted 40% in aggregate from three years ago, thanks to the last 12 months of growth. Therefore, it's fair to say the earnings growth recently has been superb for the company.\n\nLooking ahead now, EPS is anticipated to climb by 7.4% per annum during the coming three years according to the analysts following the company. That's shaping up to be materially lower than the 22% per annum growth forecast for the broader market.\n\nIn light of this, it's understandable that ACC's P/E sits below the majority of other companies. Apparently many shareholders weren't comfortable holding on while the company is potentially eyeing a less prosperous future.\n\nWhat We Can Learn From ACC's P/E?\n\nTypically, we'd caution against reading too much into price-to-earnings ratios when settling on investment decisions, though it can reveal plenty about what other market participants think about the company.\n\nWe've established that ACC maintains its low P/E on the weakness of its forecast growth being lower than the wider market, as expected. Right now shareholders are accepting the low P/E as they concede future earnings probably won't provide any pleasant surprises. It's hard to see the share price rising strongly in the near future under these circumstances.\n\nIt is also worth noting that we have found that you need to take into consideration.\n\nIt's important to make sure you look for a great company, not just the first idea you come across.

This initiative aims to help detect TB early, a major regional health issue, the Adani Foundation said.\n\nThe 'Mini90' X-ray machine is lightweight and easy to carry, making it perfect for use in remote and hilly areas, they said, adding, that it helps doctors diagnose patients quickly by providing clear images, which is especially important for checking chest, spine, and head conditions.\n\nThis will allow for better screening, resulting in faster treatment for people who need it the most in rural areas, wherein such devices may not be easily accessible.\n\nTB remains a serious concern in Bilaspur, with 249 cases per 100,000 people. The X-ray machine will help identify more cases and ensure quicker treatment.\n\nThe group said the \"ACC and the Adani Foundation are committed to supporting community welfare by focusing on projects that improve health, education, and livelihoods across all locations.\"\n\n(Disclaimer: New Delhi Television is a subsidiary of AMG Media Networks Limited, an Adani Group Company.)", "source_link":

As the principal partner, ACC’s branding is placed on the front of the team’s playing kits throughout the PKL season. This renewal underscores ACC’s long-standing commitment to nurturing Indian sports and fostering deeper community engagement, aligning with the values of perseverance and teamwork that kabaddi represents.\n\nIn addition, Gujarat Giants KC have secured a new partnership with Sunora Solar, a prominent solar energy provider known for its focus on sustainability and innovation. As the official solar energy partner, Sunora Solar’s logo is prominently featured on the team’s shorts. This collaboration reflects both parties’ shared commitment to promoting clean energy solutions, making the Giants a symbol not just of athleticism but of environmental responsibility as well.\n\nThese partnerships provide crucial support to Gujarat Giants KC, further enhancing their ability to perform on and off the mat. Moreover, they signify the role sports teams can play in advancing sustainable practices, a cause that resonates with fans and businesses alike.\n\nOn the competitive front, the Giants have been strategic in their approach to PKL 11. Retaining key players such as Parteek Dahiya and Rakesh, the team has reinforced its defensive lineup while making a bold statement by acquiring star raider Guman Singh for an impressive INR 1.97 crore at the PKL auction. This investment reflects their determination to reclaim glory in the league.\n\nGujarat Giants kicked off their campaign with a solid victory against Bengaluru Bulls, setting a strong tone for the season.

Cement demand is projected to grow in the range of 4-5 per cent in this fiscal, said the company.", "source_link": "https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/companies/acc-net-doubles-on-tax-write-back-govt-sops/article69146803.ece", "keywords": ["ACC", "Adani Group", "Ajay Kapur", "Whole Time Director and CEO", "ACC", "ACC", "a leading cement company", "higher volumes", "cost optimisation", "enhanced efficiencies"], "tags": ["Quarterly Results", "adani group", "Live News", "Elections 2024"], "article_images": "https://bl-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/rn1zg3/article69146884.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/IMG_ACCnew_2_1_4BB26G3N.jpg", "all_images": ["https://assetsbl.thehindubusinessline.com/theme/images/bl-online/menu-icon.svg", "https://assetsbl.thehindubusinessline.com/theme/images/bl-online/logo.svg", "https://assetsbl.thehindubusinessline.com/theme/images/bl-online/1x1_spacer.png", "https://bl-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/rn1zg3/article69146884.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/IMG_ACCnew_2_1_4BB26G3N.jpg", "https://assetsbl.thehindubusinessline.com/theme/images/BLRX/icon/bl-home-btn.png", "https://assetsbl.thehindubusinessline.com/theme/images/BLRX/icon/newsletter.svg", "https://assetsbl.thehindubusinessline.com/theme/images/google-signin/bl-online-icon.svg", "https://assetsbl.thehindubusinessline.com/theme/images/BLRX/graph-arrow-icon.svg", "https://assetsbl.thehindubusinessline.com/theme/images/bl-online/comment-icon.svg", "https://assetsbl.thehindubusinessline.com/theme/images/th-online/1x1_spacer.png", "https://assetsbl.thehindubusinessline.com/theme/images/google-signin/group-12945.svg", "https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/theme/images/th-online/1x1_spacer.png", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=11398210&cs_ucfr=1&cv=4.4.0&cj=1"], "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "title": "ACC net doubles on tax write back, Govt sops", "description": "ACC, a leading cement company, doubles net profit to Rs 1,092 crore in December quarter due to government incentives.", "publish-date": "2025-01-27T18:36:36+05:30", "created-date": "2025-01-27T18:36:36+05:30", "modified-date": "2025-01-27T19:43:13+05:30", "article": {"published_time": "2025-01-27T13:06:36.000Z", "modified_time": "2025-01-27T14:13:13Z", "section": "Companies", "tag": "enhanced efficiencies", "author": "BL Mumbai Bureau"}, "cXenseParse": {"articleid": 69146803, "thg-articleid": 69146803, "thg-articletype": "storyline", "title": "ACC net doubles on tax write back, Govt sops", "description": "Sales volume of the company increased 21 per cent y-on-y supported by increase in trade volumes and higher premium products"}, "al": {"android": {"url": "https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/companies/acc-net-doubles-on-tax-write-back-govt-sops/article69146803.ece", "app_name": "The HinduBusinessline"}}, "twitter": {"creator": "BL Mumbai Bureau", "title": "ACC net doubles on tax write back, Govt sops", "description": "ACC, a leading cement company, doubles net profit to Rs 1,092 crore in December quarter due to government incentives.", "image": "https://bl-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/rn1zg3/article69146884.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/IMG_ACCnew_2_1_4BB26G3N.jpg", "app": {"id": {"googleplay": "app-id=com.mobstac.thehindubusinessline", "iphone": 855182339}, "name": {"googleplay": "Business Line", "ipad": "Business Line for iPad", "iphone": "The Hindu BusinessLine for iPhone"}}, "card": "summary_large_image", "domain": "thehindubusinessline.com", "site": "@businessline"}, "keywords": "ACC ,Adani Group,Ajay Kapur, Whole Time Director and CEO, ACC,ACC, a leading cement company,higher volumes,cost optimisation ,enhanced efficiencies", "news_keywords": "ACC ,Adani Group,Ajay Kapur, Whole Time Director and CEO, ACC,ACC, a leading cement company,higher volumes,cost optimisation ,enhanced efficiencies", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "atdlayout": "articlepage", "og": {"title": "ACC net doubles on tax write back, Govt sops", "description": "ACC, a leading cement company, doubles net profit to Rs 1,092 crore in December quarter due to government incentives.", "image": "https://bl-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/rn1zg3/article69146884.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/IMG_ACCnew_2_1_4BB26G3N.jpg", "url": "https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/companies/acc-net-doubles-on-tax-write-back-govt-sops/article69146803.ece", "type": "article", "site_name": "BusinessLine"}, "google-signin-client_id": "661011008554-l3k9f4nme8caoiei7t4rqipgh537si4d.apps.googleusercontent.com", "google-site-verification": "4QLs3xEIcfA9oMf-fpRqph1PcmPX-fc20j3O_0fd5z8", "fb": {"app_id": 137450626398044, "pages": 60573550946}}, "ambuja_kawach_count": 0, "ambuja_cool_walls_count": 0, "ambuja_compocem_count": 0, "ultratech_weather_pro_flex_count": 0, "shree_aac_blocks_count": 0, "ambuja_plus_count": 0, "ultratech_flex_count": 0, "shree_adhesives_count": 0},

The brokerage expects demand to grow 5-7 per cent in FY25, driven by resumption of infrastructure projects, Govermnet’s focus on infra development and sustained real-estate activity. It added that the third quarter of FY25 is expected to be a pivotal period for cement demand, with the base effect from Q3FY24, which saw subdued demand, setting the stage for potentially stronger double-digit growth.\n\nUltraTech Cement, Ambuja Cement, Dalmia Bharat, JK Cement, Star Cement are Axis Securities’ top picks.\n\nPL Capital upgraded Ambuja Cements stock from ‘accumulate’ to ‘buy’ call with a revised target price of ₹756 against ₹701 earlier. The brokerage’s top picks in the sector also include ACC and Ultratech Cement.\n\nNuvama Institutional Equities has maintained neutral stance on the sector anticipating consolidation in the space.\n\nAnalysts of ICICI Securities, also neutral on the sector, have recommended ‘buy’ call on Ambuja Cements. They also project EBITDA to plunge 26 per cent y-o-y. “With competitive intensity unlikely to abate over the next few years and ‘consolidation virtues’ proving to be a myth so far, we see risk to FY26 earnings as well,” they added.\n\nMeanwhile, Axis Securities quoted that the acquisition of Penna Cement by Ambuja Cements and the acquisition of India Cement by UltraTech Cement indicate a trend toward higher consolidation within the cement industry.\n\nNuvama said that the second quarter has been “seasonally tepid with subdued demand along with weak pricing.” It observed that the earnings downgrades for FY25E/26E are on the cards considering the volatile pricing environment. The brokerage has recommended buy rating on JK Cement and ACC and a hold call each on UltraTech Cement, Ambuja Cements, Shree Cements and Grasim Industries.\n\nPricing and cost\n\nYes Securities said that the sector may witness some respite from the cost front considering stable diesel prices, higher usage of green energy, and other cost initiatives.\n\nHowever, the decline in cost may not cushion the overall impact of lower cement prices and subdued demand contributing to the overall decline in profitability.\n\nAnalysts of Elara Securities also expect a gradual recovery in cement demand in the upcoming quarter, which should enable the sector with the bandwidth to take some price hikes.\n\nNoting that cement prices are expected to trend higher on plans to implement price hikes again in October 2024, Axis Securities stated that the sustainability of these higher prices remains a challenge.\n\nEBITA margin to shrink\n\nAxis Securities anticipated that EBITDA margins are expected to shrink by 220 bps y-o-y and by 230 bps q-o-q, reflecting the challenging operating environment and pricing pressures.\n\n“Sluggish demand, weak pricing and operating deleverage are likely to drag EBITDA for our coverage by 15 per cent y-o-y (down 23 per cent q-o-q),” Nuvama’s report read.", "source_link":

Our financial results this quarter – fuelled by higher volumes, cost optimization, increasing efficiencies, and agility – build the momentum for our growth strategy for FY’25 and beyond. Our growth is being driven by robust demand for high-quality cement products across all markets, as well as our continuous efforts to optimise operations and lead on all ESG parameters. Our leadership status is highlighted in our drive for operational excellence supported by innovation, sustainability, and a customer-centric approach. We continue to deliver strong value for our stakeholders as we aim for sustained profitability through our competitive advantage.”\n\nOperational Highlights\n\nKPIs like volumes, efficiencies, cost and capex have shown healthy improvements in reinforcing cost leadership journey.\n\nVolume increased by 15% YoY supported by increase in trade volumes and higher premium product volumes (14% YoY), ensuring market leadership.\n\nOptimised Fuel Basket, improved linkage and captive coal consumption and synergies with Group companies have resulted in 15% reduction in Kiln fuel cost.\n\nThermal value reduced from 768 kCal to 735 kCal, expect further improvement in coming quarters.\n\nFinancial Highlights\n\nHighest ever revenue in Q2 series over last 5 years at Rs. 4,614Cr, driven by higher trade sales volume (up by 2%) and premium product as % of trade sales at 36% (up by 3.7 pp YoY)\n\nOperating EBITDA at Rs. 436 Cr, EBITDA margin at 9.5%.\n\nCash & Cash equivalent at Rs. 2,921 Cr, with Net Worth at Rs. 16,725 Cr, up by Rs. 172 Cr during the current quarter\n\nEPS (Diluted) at Rs. 10.5 during the quarter.\n\nESG Updates\n\nACC has released its Sustainability Report for FY’24, which is now available on the company’s website\n\nThe range of innovative products, including ACC ECOMaxX, ACC AEROMaxX, and ACC Coolcrete, continues to expand, adding to the wide array of eco-friendly options\n\nACC is committed to achieving Net Zero by 2050. Ambuja and ACC are the only two cement companies in India undergoing Net Zero target validation from SBTi\n\nACC achieved a TSR of 10.2% and Green energy usage of 14.1% in Q2 FY’25, significantly higher than the comparable figures in Q2 FY’24\n\nACC utilized over 6.4 million tonnes of waste-derived resources in H1 FY’25, embracing the principles of a circular economy\n\nACC is committed to planting 5.93 million trees by 2030, in alignment with the Adani Group’s plan to plant 100 million trees\n\nACC has created societal value for over 1.45 million people up to H1 FY’25 through various activities in education, healthcare, skill development, and sustainable livelihoods\n\nBranding and Technical Services\n\nACC launched new Brand Film ‘The Bridge of Unity’, honouring the glorious diversity of India on 78th Independence Day\n\nACC presents #BharoseKeSaathi, short documentary celebrating the stories of success of contractors associated with ACC over the years.\n\nCelebrated Engineer’s Day by organising various activities during September month, including Concrete Talks, technical lectures, panel and group discussions.\n\nConducted 'Skill Building Workshops' across various domains for ~8,900+ Contractors during H1 FY’25.\n\nDigitalisation\n\nA state-of-the-art in-plant automation covering automated weighbridge operations, vehicle movement control and tracking, vehicle identification, intelligent order allocation, auto truck sequencing, and packing plant automation has been implemented across some plants\n\n‘Adani Cement Connect’- the Digital Sales platform allows dealers to place orders and check real-time outstanding payments, invoices, credit and debit notes\n\n‘Adani Rewards Connect’ - the Digital Rewards platform – enables contractors, dealers, and retailers to check their loyalty gains and redeem them using the rewards catalogue\n\nThe Company has made significant advancements in its digitalization journey by modernizing its network infrastructure and implementation of SD-WAN, resulting in faster order processing and quicker business transactions.\n\nOutlook\n\nOverall, industry expects improvement in demand in H2 FY 2025, which is likely to be driven by post monsoon pickup in construction and housing activity. Government’s continued focus on infrastructure development - roads, highways, railways, and metros – will continue to remain as the key demand driver.

The second one is Shree Cement . These two companies are going to do well, even though there is trouble in the industry right now. A lot of cost initiative programmes are going to happen. But for UltraTech and Ambuja, valuations are higher and for Ambuja, whatever acquisitions they have done, it is going to ultimately benefit ACC. So, ACC is his top pick. Ambuja will have a sell rating, as will UltraTech because it has very high valuations. One can add Birla Corp, Dalmia in their portfolio.So, yes, in November, a price hike was what the Street and the dealers and distributors were expecting for cement, but there was no price hike. In fact, in October and November, on a month-on-month basis, the prices are flattish. The prices are five years below the line right now. And the major impact was in southern regions. In the north and eastern regions, prices are more or less stable. In the other three regions, the prices have actually declined. There was a sharp correction. I believe the prices have bottomed out.From here, I do not see much price correction. But yes, the price will be more or less stable for the next few quarters. The only problem was there is no demand pickup in October and November and that is the only concern on pricing pressures. So, on a month-on-month basis, October and November prices are flattish.There are a lot of announcements but ultimately the market is not accepting the price hike and that is the reason why even in December, even in the few pockets that have taken a price hike, it was rolled back ultimately because of subdued demand. In December, people are expecting a Rs 30-40 price hike but I do not think that will be possible because the market is not accepting the price hike. At most, there may be a hike of Rs 10-15, but it will be rolled back.In the first half of FY25, the aggregate volume of all the 18 companies was around 156 to 165 million tonnes. What people and the Street are expecting is 8-9% volume growth for the second half, but that is highly impossible. Last year, 1Q FY24 aggregate volume was somewhere around 190. Even at 8-9%, it will still be below 350-360 levels of volume growth. I do not see any kind of volume growth in the second half and the yearly volume growth will be much less.In fact, it will be a degrowth of 2-3% on a year-on-year basis. If anything meaningful happens in terms of volumes, that can be seen in the middle of FY26; that is my assumption. But December, January, February is the harvesting season and labour issues will be there.The concern here is the consolidations. Larger players are aggressively expanding their capacity just to gain quick market shares. That is where the pricing pressure is coming. The second thing is that the industry is going to add somewhere around 110 to 120 million tonne in the next two to three years of time because a lot of larger players, whatever they have mentioned their capacity announcement, so more or less everything is going to come within 28 and 30.Ideally, out of 110 to 120 million tonnes of capacity, 70-75 million tonnes of capacity will be greenfield expansions, which will again as everybody knows greenfield expansion takes time. Rest of the 25-30 million tonnes of capacity that will be somewhere by way of acquisition, inorganic acquisition or something. And few companies are still, India is having around 120 to 130 million tonnes of capacity which can be acquired by the larger company.From the last quarter, whatever the conference call with the companies and all, everybody is a little bothered. That means they are tending more towards volume rather than pricing. That is creating pricing pressure in the industry.: Among top picks, ACC is what I can recommend at this moment at this level. The second one is Shree Cement. These two companies are going to do well, even though there is trouble in the industry right now, because a lot of cost initiative programmes are going to happen. But for UltraTech and Ambuja, in my knowledge, valuations are higher and for Ambuja, whatever acquisitions they have done, it is going to ultimately benefit ACC, not the standalone as Ambuja. So, ACC is my top pick. Ambuja will be my sell rating and UltraTech also because it has very high valuations, it will be a sell rating for me. And one can add Birla Corp, Dalmia in their portfolio.", "source_link":

I take pride in Orient Cement’s impressive track record of building premium brands and maintaining a leading market share in the geographies it operates in.

The transaction is set to be completed within the next three to four months, after which the management of the cement company will transition to Adani Cement.\n\nBy Padala Santosh Published Date - 30 December 2024, 04:55 PM\n\nMancherial: The Adani Group’s October 2024 buyout of CK Birla Group’s Orient Cement Company (OCC) in Devapur of Kasipet mandal here has triggered job security worries among the company’s employees.\n\nOCC, established by the CK Birla Group at Devapur village 42 years ago, was taken over by Adani Cement at an equity value of Rs.8,100 crore in October. The transaction will be completed in three to four months. The management of the cement manufacturer will be soon shifted to Adani Cement.\n\nAlso Read KTR questions Rahul Gandhi on Congress party’s double standards on Adani issue\n\nHowever, employees have their own concerns. At present, the company has 2,358 employees including permanent, contract, management and loading staff. The employees fear that the new management will slash the workforce. They also fear that the new management might not fulfill promises made by the existing one. They are planning to launch protests soon.\n\n“The taking over of one company by another is part and parcel of business. But the management of the cement company must strive to fulfil its promises made in the past. Else, we will begin a stir if injustice is done to the employees,” Ch Tirupathi Reddy, working president of the recognized trade union of the OCC said.\n\nThe existing management had promised to establish a fourth unit and assured to provide 4,000 opportunities to locals displaced by acquisition of lands affected by air pollution. It also promised to create basic amenities like education facilities, healthcare infrastructure, roads, etc., to the villagers at the time of founding the company. It has allegedly not honoured orders of the High Court with regard to these assurances.\n\nMeanwhile, former MLC and OCC permanent workers union president Ramulu Naik announced that he would stage a day-long sit-in in front of the company if the present management did not set up the fourth unit in Devapur on Tuesday. He stated that the employees were insecure about their future.\n\n2,000 metric tonnes of cement per day\n\nThe CK Birla Group began work on the plant in 1979 and commissioned it in September 1982 with an installed capacity of 2,000 metric tonnes of cement per day.

Ambuja says it plans to optimise OCL’s overall capacity utilisation to enhance its cost and competitiveness and improve its operating performance.\n\n“This timed acquisition marks another significant step forward in Ambuja Cements’ accelerated growth journey, increasing cement capacity by ~30 MTPA within two years of Ambuja’s acquisition,” says Karan Adani, director, Ambuja Cements.", "source_link": "https://www.fortuneindia.com/enterprise/adani-led-ambuja-cements-buys-47-stake-in-orient-cement-for-8100-cr/118870", "keywords": ["ambuja cements", "adani cements", "adani group", "orient cement"], "tags": ["Adani Group", "Orient Cement", "Adani Cements", "India's Richest", "Ambuja Cements"], "article_images": "https://media.assettype.com/fortuneindia/2023-03/818116d5-0304-4062-8aa8-a7787ecf6d3c/Adani_Image.jpg?w=700", "all_images": ["https://images.assettype.com/fortuneindia/2025-02-12/ochbp85n/Capture.avif?w=100&q=95", "https://media.assettype.com/fortuneindia/2023-03/818116d5-0304-4062-8aa8-a7787ecf6d3c/Adani_Image.jpg?w=700", "https://images.assettype.com/fortuneindia/2022-03/84bee52b-62f9-48f5-b6f2-bc8dd1d978d2/Nirmala_Sitharaman.jpg?rect=0,58,2047,1151&w=100&q=95", "https://images.assettype.com/fortuneindia/2025-01-25/n97itffv/Religare.jpg?w=100&q=95", "https://images.assettype.com/fortuneindia/2023-03/818116d5-0304-4062-8aa8-a7787ecf6d3c/Adani_Image.jpg?w=480&h=270&q=60&fit=cover", "https://images.assettype.com/fortuneindia/2025-02-12/b1aqlc0e/Ramdeo-2.jpg?w=100&q=95", "https://images.assettype.com/fortuneindia/2021-12/e78d5cab-0f50-46e4-93d5-0f4b5178927c/Piyush_Goyal_01865_copy.jpg?rect=0,0,2700,1519&w=100&q=95"], "article_metadata": {"title": "Adani-led Ambuja Cements buys 47% stake in Orient Cement for ₹8,100 cr | Fortune India", "description": "The Ambuja-Orient deal marks another acquisition after  ₹10,422 cr Penna Cement buyout in June this year; to boost Ambuja's capacity by 16.6 mn tonnes", "keywords": "ambuja cements ,adani cements ,adani group ,orient cement", "news_keywords": "Ambuja Cements ,Adani Cements ,Adani Group ,Orient Cement", "image_src": "https://media.assettype.com/fortuneindia/2023-03/818116d5-0304-4062-8aa8-a7787ecf6d3c/Adani_Image.jpg?w=700", "og": {"title": "Adani-led Ambuja Cements buys 47% stake in Orient Cement for ₹8,100 cr", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.fortuneindia.com/enterprise/adani-led-ambuja-cements-buys-47-stake-in-orient-cement-for-8100-cr/118870", "site-name": "Fortune India", "description": "The Ambuja-Orient deal marks another acquisition after  ₹10,422 cr Penna Cement buyout in June this year; to boost Ambuja's capacity by 16.6 mn tonnes", "image": {"identifier": "https://media.assettype.com/fortuneindia/2023-03/818116d5-0304-4062-8aa8-a7787ecf6d3c/Adani_Image.jpg?w=700", "width": 2048, "height": 1169}}, "twitter": {"title": "Adani-led Ambuja Cements buys 47% stake in Orient Cement for ₹8,100 cr", "description": "The Ambuja-Orient deal marks another acquisition after  ₹10,422 cr Penna Cement buyout in June this year; to boost Ambuja's capacity by 16.6 mn tonnes", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@fortuneindia", "image": {"src": "https://media.assettype.com/fortuneindia/2023-03/818116d5-0304-4062-8aa8-a7787ecf6d3c/Adani_Image.jpg?w=700"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 1394570037245344}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/fortuneind/", "category": "enterprise"}, "al": {"android": {"url": "quintypefb://https://www.fortuneindia.com/enterprise/adani-led-ambuja-cements-buys-47-stake-in-orient-cement-for-8100-cr/118870"}}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=5", "google-site-verification": "dIBTf8SsCMPRDW06MTh_cEuhd7eNFXOCcxl1goTT0Cs", "msvalidate.01": "16C1B4A8FD9A29E3D5AFC3EF251C77A8", "page": {"type": "story"}}, "ambuja_kawach_count": 0, "ambuja_cool_walls_count": 0, "ambuja_compocem_count": 0, "ultratech_weather_pro_flex_count": 0, "shree_aac_blocks_count": 0, "ambuja_plus_count": 0, "ultratech_flex_count": 0, "shree_adhesives_count": 0},

This move, alon", "article_body": "Photo/Agencies\n\nMUMBAI: Gautam Adani-controlled Ambuja Cements will acquire a 47 per cent stake in Orient Cement from Chandra Kant Birla and his family for Rs 3,791 crore as it looks to topple UltraTech Cement , owned by Kumar Mangalam Birla, from the top position in the industry.As part of the acquisition process, Ambuja — the number two player — will also make an open offer for an additional 26 per cent stake to Orient’s public shareholders, totalling Rs 2,112 crore in compliance with India’s takeover regulations. This acquisition will be Ambuja’s fifth since its takeover by Adani in Sept 2022, following the purchase of Hyderabad-based Penna Cement in June.Orient, which had also reportedly attracted interest from UltraTech and Sajjan Jindal’s JSW Cement, operates two plants in Telangana and Karnataka, and one in Maharashtra. The deal will boost Ambuja’s cement capacity by 8.5 million tonnes, bringing its total capacity to 97 million tonnes, with a target of reaching 140 million tonnes by 2028. In comparison, UltraTech currently has a capacity of over 180 million tonnes and aims to reach 200 million tonnes by 2027.The decision to sell Orient aligns with the C K Birla Group’s strategy of reallocating capital to prioritise certain businesses over others. The $3-billion conglomerate recently made moves to expand its presence in the healthcare sector by acquiring two fertility chains, BabyScience and ARMC, increasing its network to 50 clinics across the country. Additionally, in March, the group acquired Topline — a well-known pipes and fittings brand in East India — to strengthen its home and building materials portfolio. TheCK Birla Group intends to focus on consumer, IT, home & building materials, and healthcare businesses as it aims to double its turnover to $6 billion within the next five years.C K Birla, chairman of the C K Birla Group and whose grandfather was the brother of Kumar Mangalam Birla’s great grandfather, expressed confidence in the Adani Group’s ability to drive continued growth at Orient Cement, benefiting both its employees and stakeholders. “We are confident that the Adani Group , with its strong focus on cement and infrastructure, is the ideal new owner to drive continued growth at Orient Cement for our people and stakeholders,” said C K Birla.Ambuja expects its market share to increase by 2 per cent following the Orient deal, and will pay Rs 395.4 per share of the target company.However, the Orient stock closed at Rs 343 on the BSE on Tuesday, below the offer price, leading some analysts to question whether the deal will receive approval from the competition commission. Adani's acquisition of Penna and UltraTech's purchase of India Cements are also currently pending regulatory approval.Ambuja plans to finance the Orient transaction through internal accruals, having accumulated over Rs 23,000 crore in cash after Adani infused funds into the cement company through warrants that were later converted into equity shares. The acquisition of Orient is expected to complement Ambuja's existing cement footprint, reduce overall lead distances and logistics costs, and ultimately improve its market share.Orient's appeal as an acquisition target lies in its position as one of the lowest-cost cement producers with minimal debt, making it a more cost-effective option for Ambuja compared to building a cement plant from scratch. Furthermore, Orient’s capacity can be doubled to about 17 million tonnes. It also possesses a limestone mine in Chittorgarh, Rajasthan, where an additional six million-tonne plant can be established.", "source_link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/ambuja-buys-orient-cement-from-ck-birla-for-3791-crore/articleshow/114482975.cms", "keywords": ["Business news", "UltraTech Cement", "Orient Cement", "CK Birla", "cement capacity", "Ambuja Cements", "Adani Group"], "tags": ["Adani Group"], "article_images": "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114483043,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-786903,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg", "all_images": ["https://static.toiimg.com/photo/91617419.cms", "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114483043,imgsize-786903,width-400,resizemode-4/114483043.jpg", "https://static.toiimg.com/photo/91617445.cms", "https://static.toiimg.com/photo/83033472.cms", "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114483043,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-786903,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg", "https://static.toiimg.com/photo/92222747.cms", "https://static.toiimg.com/photo/91617478.cms", "https://static.toiimg.com/photo/91617463.cms", "https://static.toiimg.com/photo/91617514.cms", "https://static.toiimg.com/photo/87458172.cms", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=593671331875494&ev=PageView&noscript=1"], "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "India Business News: Ambuja Cements, controlled by Gautam Adani, is set to acquire a 47% stake in Orient Cement from Chandra Kant Birla for Rs 3,791 crore.

The promoters of Orient Cement , including members of the CK Birla family and associated companies, have entered into a Share Purchase Agreement (SPA) with Ambuja Cements to sell their 37.90% stake in the company.The deal, announced on October 22, 2024, will see the promoters offload 7,76,49,413 equity shares at a price of Rs 395.40 per share which works out to Rs 3070 crore. As per SEBI regulations, Ambuja Cements will be required to make an open offer to other shareholders, providing them with an opportunity to exit their investment valuing the company at Rs 8100 cr.This acquisition marks another chapter in the ongoing consolidation of the Indian cement sector. Aditya Birla Group's UltraTech Cement and the Adani Group have been aggressively expanding their footprint through acquisitions. Earlier this year, Adani acquired Penna Cement , while UltraTech Cement gained majority control in India Cements.Interestingly, JSW Cement had also evaluated acquiring a stake in Orient Cement, but Adani ultimately emerged as the buyer. Negotiations with other potential acquirers, including UltraTech, reportedly faced delays due to valuation disagreements and concerns over environmental clearances for key limestone mines.The acquisition of Orient Cement, with its 8.5 million tons per annum (MTPA) capacity, will significantly bolster Ambuja Cement's market share and strengthen its position in the industry. The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and the fulfillment of other conditions precedent outlined in the SPA.Following the acquisition, the board of Orient Cement will be reconstituted to include directors from Ambuja Cements. The SPA also includes provisions related to standstill covenants, representations and warranties, indemnities, brand usage, and non-solicit and non-compete obligations.This strategic move by Ambuja Cements is expected to have a considerable impact on the Indian cement market, potentially leading to reduced competition and creating opportunities for synergies and further expansion.", "source_link": "https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/adani-group-to-acquire-orient-cement-at-rs-8100-crore-valuation/articleshow/114453926.cms", "keywords": ["Business news", "UltraTech Cement", "Share Purchase Agreement", "Penna Cement", "Orient Cement", "JSW Cement", "Indian cement industry", "CK Birla family", "Ambuja Cements", "Adani Group"], "tags": ["Adani Group"], "article_images": "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114454024,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-745944,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg", "all_images": ["https://static.toiimg.com/photo/91617419.cms", "https://static.toiimg.com/photo/91617445.cms", "https://static.toiimg.com/photo/83033472.cms", "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114454024,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-745944,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg", "https://static.toiimg.com/photo/92222747.cms", "https://static.toiimg.com/photo/91617478.cms", "https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114454024,imgsize-745944,width-400,resizemode-4/114454024.jpg", "https://static.toiimg.com/photo/91617463.cms", "https://static.toiimg.com/photo/91617514.cms", "https://static.toiimg.com/photo/87458172.cms", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=593671331875494&ev=PageView&noscript=1"], "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "description": "India Business News: Ambuja Cements, owned by the Adani Group, announced acquiring a 37.90% stake in Orient Cement from the CK Birla family for Rs 3070 crore.

Ambuja Cements will acquire the promoter's 37.90% stake in Orient Cement, and an additional 8.90% from the company's public shareholders, at ₹395.40 a share.The company will then launch an open offer to acquire another 26% in the company at the same price. The transaction will be funded entirely through internal accruals.\"The deal is working out to a value of around $114 per tonne,\" said Ravi Sodah, analyst, Elara Securities. \"The price is higher than that paid for Sanghi and Penna, but in line with the India Cement deal,\" he said.In July, CEO Ajay Kapur had said that there is no “frenzy” in the industry, and that expansion is happening in a structured manner. He said the cost of acquisition for both Sanghi Industries and Penna Cement was below $90 per tonne.“Our internal target for new growth is less than $80/tonne. In fact, the target given to the operating team is to further drive it down by another $5-10,” he had said then.Apart from Adani, Kumar Mangalam Birla-led UltraTech Cement and Sajjan Jindal-led JSW Cement were also in the race to acquire Orient Cement. In October 2023, ET reported that chairman CK Birla had reached out to Adani Group chairman Gautam Adani to sell his stake in the firm. “This timed acquisition marks another significant step forward in Ambuja Cements’ accelerated growth journey, increasing cement capacity by ~30 MTPA within two years of acquisition,” said Ambuja Cements director Karan Adani.While there has been an interest in the assets of Orient Cement from multiple players for a long time, ultimately, the buyer was identified based on the value and what would suit our stakeholders the best, CK Birla Group’s chief financial officer Madhavan H told ET.Orient Cement currently has three operational units across Maharashtra , Telangana and Karnataka , with a total production capacity of 8.5 million tonne (mt), and statutory clearances to increase production capacity by another 8.1 mt. It also has high-quality limestone reserves at Chittorgarh, Rajasthan, where an additional 6 mt of capacity can be set up.Public shareholders whose stake Ambuja Cements will be acquiring include Rukmani Birla Educational Society, Shri Jagannath Educational Institute, and a few other trusts. These are not a part of the promoter group, Madhavan of the CK Birla Group clarified. Subject to approval from the Competition Commission of India, Adani Cement plans to complete the acquisition in three-four months.“OCL’s strategic locations, high-quality limestone reserves and requisite statutory approvals present an opportunity to increase cement capacity in the near term to 16.6 MTPA,” Karan Adani said.The buyout of Orient Cement is not only expected to strengthen Adani Cement’s market share by another 200 basis points, but will also help bring down its freight costs , the company said in its investor presentation.", "source_link":

Accelerates Ambuja’s journey to achieve 100+ MTPA operational capacity in FY 25. Provides 6 MTPA potential additional capacity in North India, leveraging OCL’s high quality limestone reserves in Rajasthan.\n\nAmbuja Cements, the cement and building material company of Adani Cement and part of the diversified Adani Group, today announced the signing of a binding agreement for the acquisition of Orient Cement Ltd (OCL) at an equity value of Rs. 81 billion. Ambuja will acquire 46.8% shares of OCL from its current promoters and certain public shareholders. The acquisition will be fully funded through internal accruals.\n\n“This timed acquisition marks another significant step forward in Ambuja Cements’ accelerated growth journey, increasing cement capacity by ~30 MTPA within two years of Ambuja’s acquisition,” said Mr Karan Adani, Director of Ambuja Cements. “By acquiring OCL, Ambuja is poised to reach 100 MTPA cement capacity in FY 25. The acquisition will help to expand Adani Cement’s presence in core markets and improve its pan-India market share by 2%. OCL’s assets are highly efficient, equipped with railway sidings and well supported by captive power plants, renewable energy, WHRS and AFR facilities. OCL’s strategic locations, high-quality limestone reserves and requisite statutory approvals present an opportunity to increase cement capacity in the near term to 16.6 MTPA.”\n\nMr CK Birla, Chairman of Orient Cement and the CK Birla Group, said, “The CK Birla Group is continuously reallocating capital to sharpen its focus on consumer centric, technology driven and service-based businesses. I take pride in Orient Cement’s impressive track record of building premium brands and maintaining a leading market share in the geographies it operates in. We are confident that the Adani Group, with its strong focus on cement and infrastructure, is the ideal new owner to drive continued growth at Orient Cement for our people and stakeholders”.\n\nMs Amita Birla, Co-Chairman, CK Birla Group, added, “Orient Cement has a strong market presence, with sustainability initiatives, particularly in renewable energy, being a significant part of its DNA. I am convinced that Ambuja Cements is the right home for all our colleagues at Orient Cement, as well as our customers.”\n\nOCL has 5.6 MTPA clinker capacity and 8.5 MTPA cement capacity along with statutory clearance to increase the clinker capacity by another 6.0 MTPA and cement capacity by another 8.1 MTPA. In addition, OCL also has a limestone mining lease in Chittorgarh for setting up an Integrated Unit (IU) with clinker of 4 MTPA and a split Grinding Unit (GU) of 6 MTPA in North India. OCL has also secured a concession from MPPGCL, Madhya Pradesh for setting up a Grinding Unit within the premises of Satpura Thermal Power Plant. Both these complement the Adani Group’s existing cement footprint. (Refer Annexure – 1 for OCL’s location wise cement capacity and other assets and Annexure - 2 for Adani Cement’s footprint post-acquisition of OCL.)\n\nOCL has recently commissioned a WHRS in Chittapur IU and is in the final stage of commissioning 16 MW solar in Chittapur and 3.7 MW solar in Jalgaon. OCL’s efficient plants, highly motivated teams, strong balance sheet and well-distributed dealer network will be excellent additions to the Adani Group’s existing cement business. OCL’s existing dealers will move to Adani Cement’s market network, creating formidable synergies.\n\nAmbuja plans to optimise OCL’s overall capacity utilisation to enhance its cost and competitiveness and improve its operating performance while leveraging the synergies inherent in the existing cement business.\n\nClick here for free registration to World Cement", "source_link": "https://www.worldcement.com/indian-subcontinent/22102024/adani-acquires-orient-cement-at-inr-8100-crore-equity-value/", "keywords": ["Ambuja", "Cement", "Orient Cement Ltd", "OCL", "Indian", "stake", "cement", "industry", "economics"], "tags": ["India cement news"], "article_images": "https://d23p67eaj7q4a1.cloudfront.net/media/articles/pop/handshake103.jpg", "all_images": ["https://d23p67eaj7q4a1.cloudfront.net/media/articles/thumb/decarbonisation101.jpg", "https://d1eq5d5e447quq.cloudfront.net/media/free.png", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=778510952260052&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://d23p67eaj7q4a1.cloudfront.net/media/logo.png", "https://bat.bing.com/action/0?ti=5667065&Ver=2", "https://tpc.googlesyndication.com/simgad/15405116606995025670", "https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=5369002&fmt=gif", "https://d23p67eaj7q4a1.cloudfront.net/media/articles/pop/handshake103.jpg"], "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "description": "Ambuja enters into a binding agreement to acquire 46.8% stake in Orient Cement Ltd (OCL).", "keywords": "Ambuja, Cement, Orient Cement Ltd, OCL , Indian, stake, cement, industry, economics", "robots": "all", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@world_cement", "title": "Adani acquires Orient Cement at INR 8100 crore equity value", "description": "Ambuja enters into a binding agreement to acquire 46.8% stake in Orient Cement Ltd (OCL).", "image": {"src": "https://d23p67eaj7q4a1.cloudfront.net/media/articles/pop/handshake103.jpg"}, "url": "https://www.worldcement.com/indian-subcontinent/22102024/adani-acquires-orient-cement-at-inr-8100-crore-equity-value/"}, "og": {"site_name": "World Cement", "title": "Adani acquires Orient Cement at INR 8100 crore equity value", "description": "Ambuja enters into a binding agreement to acquire 46.8% stake in Orient Cement Ltd (OCL).", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.worldcement.com/indian-subcontinent/22102024/adani-acquires-orient-cement-at-inr-8100-crore-equity-value/", "image": {"identifier": "https://d23p67eaj7q4a1.cloudfront.net/media/articles/pop/handshake103.jpg", "url": "http://static.worldcement.com/media/articles/pop/handshake103.jpg", "secure_url": "https://d23p67eaj7q4a1.cloudfront.net/media/articles/pop/handshake103.jpg", "width": 450, "height": 300}}, "article": {"published_time": "2024-10-22T08:46:00", "section": "Indian Subcontinent", "tag": "India cement news"}}, "ambuja_kawach_count": 0, "ambuja_cool_walls_count": 0, "ambuja_compocem_count": 0, "ultratech_weather_pro_flex_count": 0, "shree_aac_blocks_count": 0, "ambuja_plus_count": 0, "ultratech_flex_count": 0, "shree_adhesives_count": 0},

Orient stock up 45% in last 1 month.", "article_body": "\n\n\n\n(You can now subscribe to our\n\n(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel\n\nKumar Mangalam Birla flagship UltraTech is in advanced negotiations with the promoter of Orient Cement Ltd (OCL), his uncle CK Birla, after restarting talks in recent weeks, amid intensifying consolidation efforts in the sector, said people familiar with the discussions. Kumar Birla 's renewed efforts to buy Orient are seen as an attempt to trump Adani Cement and consolidate UltraTech’s position in the southern and western markets, especially Maharashtra and Telangana, after buying a 23% stake in India Cements at the end of last month. Adani Cement, which controls India's second largest cement capacity, has been engaged in talks with CK Birla since late last year but is said to have baulked at the valuation sought.UltraTech’s spokesperson was unavailable for comment. Deepak Khetrapal, MD and CEO of OCL, denied discussions were taking place and any talk of sale plans was a “figment of one’s imagination.”The promoter stake in Orient Cement held by the Birla family and private investment vehicles is 37.9%. The company has a market value of Rs 6,290.50 crore, having almost doubled from Rs 3,878 crore in October when ET first reported on CK Birla’s approach to Adani.UltraTech is said to have offered a price of Rs 350-375 per share, a 22% premium to the current market price of Rs 307. In the past month, the Orient Cement stock has shot up 45%, hitting an all-time high of Rs 329 on July 1, largely on speculation that an acquisition deal was near conclusion.The UltraTech offer translates to an enterprise value of Rs 7,300-7,800 crore ($840-$938 million) or $109-110 per ton based on Orient Cement's current installed capacity of 8.5 million tons per annum, aligning with recent transactions in the range of $90-110 per ton for mid-tier companies. The India Cement investment by UltraTech at Rs 267 a share also translates to $93 per ton. Last month, the Adani Group, through Ambuja Cement, acquired South-based Penna Cement at $90 per ton. In 2019, UltraTech acquired the cement assets of Century Textiles at $91 per ton valuation and those of Kesoram Industries in November 2023 at an implied valuation of $95 per tonne through a share swap.According to one of the persons cited, Adani’s offer was also contingent on obtaining environmental clearance for the expansion phase in Telangana, which the current Orient management was unable to commit to definitively.“UltraTech's offer carries weight due to the family association and cross holdings in Pilani Investments, holding company of the Birla family,” said one of the persons cited.A formal announcement is expected before or during Orient Cement's upcoming quarterly earnings scheduled for July 19. However, the final valuation is still being worked upon and the deal may not happen if there’s a mismatch, said the people cited. A successful closure will accelerate Birla’s plans to achieve a 200 million tons per annum (MTPA) capacity for UltraTech by 2027. At the end of May 2024, UltraTech's capacity stood at 152.69 MTPA, excluding Kesoram's capacity of 10.75 MTPA.Linkages to limestone mines are a key factor in determining cement asset valuations.Following a government directive, Orient Cement transferred the mining lease held by it for limestone, a key raw material for cement, in the Ralli reserve forest in Telangana to Telangana State Mineral Development Corp. (TSMDC) in 2000. TSMDC in turn obtained renewal of the mining lease over an extent of 210 hectares and awarded the raising-cum-self consumption contract of the Devapura I Mines to Orient Cement to sustain its cement plant. TSMDC has been charging 25% royalty as premium for the limestone supplied. The average production is 3.101 MTPA.In 2018 Orient Cement declared to double its capacity to 16 MTPA with an investment of Rs 2000 crore based on the supply contract of limestone from TSMDC (Devapura II Mines – 275 Hectors). To supply the limestone to Orient cement plant, TSMDC proposed to produce 9.06 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) of limestone from this mine eventually. The bilateral contract between Orient and TSMDC – is likely to come up for renewal by 2025 (for another 25 year tenure). The first lease of Devapura I was to get exhausted last year and therefore Devapura II (588 Hector) was proposed to supply both existing and expanded capacity of Orient Cement. The mining lease deed of Devapur II is believed to be still pending.In its FY23 annual report, Orient Cement noted the reopening of its Rajasthan mines and its intention to enter Northern Indian markets with a greenfield capacity of over three million tons, diversifying its geographical reach to mitigate risks. This strategic direction has contributed to Orient Cement commanding a higher valuation compared to standalone regional cement companies.According to one of the sources, Adani’s offer was also contingent on obtaining environmental clearance for the expansion phase in Telangana, which the current Orient management was unable to commit to definitively. The source added, \"Ultratech's offer carries weight due to the family association and cross holdings in Pilani Investments.”Orient Cement reported a sales volume of 1.72 million tons per annum in the fourth quarter of FY24, with total sales for the year reaching 6.13 million tons per annum, as per the post-earnings transcript on the stock exchange. The company achieved 81% utilization in the fourth quarter, with sequential sales volume growth of 24%. Headquartered in Bhuvneshwar, Orient Cement saw its revenue grow by 8.5% to Rs 3200 crore in FY24, with net profit rising by 42% to Rs 174 crore. The company has been focusing on increasing the proportion of premium cement sales, which accounted for 22% of total volume in FY24, up from 14% in the previous fiscal year.", "source_link":

Ambuja will acquire 46.8 per cent shares of OCL from its current promoters (CK Birla Group) and certain public shareholders.\n\n\"This timed acquisition marks another significant step forward in Ambuja Cements’ accelerated growth journey, increasing cement capacity by 30 million tons per annum (MTPA) within two years of Ambuja’s acquisition,” said Karan Adani, director of Ambuja Cements.\n\nBy acquiring OCL, Ambuja is poised to reach 100 MTPA cement capacity in the current financial year noted Adani.\n\n\"The acquisition will help to expand Adani Cement’s presence in core markets and improve its pan-India market share by 2 per cent,\" he added.\n\nEarlier, Ambuja had acquired Penna Cement Industries.\n\nCK Birla, the chairman of Orient Cement, pointed that the group is continuously reallocating capital as it looks to sharpen its focus on consumer centric, technology driven and service-based businesses.\n\nOCL has 5.6 MTPA clinker capacity and 8.5 MTPA cement capacity along with statutory clearance to increase the clinker capacity by another 6.0 MTPA and cement capacity by another 8.1 MTPA. Additionally, OCL also has a limestone mining lease in Chittorgarh, Rajasthan for setting up an integrated unit (with clinker of 4 MTPA and a split grinding unit of 6 MTPA in North India.\n\nThe Aditya Birla Group, whose UltraTech is the market leader in the cement industry has also been strengthening its position. Earlier this year, UltraTech acquired a stake in India Cements.\n\nIn 2023, UltraTech had acquired the cement business of Kesoram Industries. With the acquisitions and it's own expansion, UltraTech's cement capacity will surpass 200 MTPA by financial year 2027, Chairman Kumar Mangalam Birla had said earlier this year at the company's annual general meeting.\n\nSajjan Jindal-led JSW Cement too has been exploring acquisitions to grow its cement and was also reportedly in the race to buy the Orient Cement stake.\n\nJSW Cement had filed papers earlier this year to raise around Rs 4,000 crore via an initial public offering. The issue was put on hold by market regulator SEBI in September.\n\nOn Tuesday, Orient Cement shares were 2.3 per cent lower at Rs 344.25 on the BSE in noon trading. Ambuja Cements was down 1.6 per cent at Rs 563. UltraTech was up 0.6 per cent at Rs 10,938.95.\n\n\n\n\n\n", "source_link": "https://www.theweek.in/news/biz-tech/2024/10/22/adani-owned-ambuja-acquires-orient-cement-stake-from-ck-birla-group.html", "keywords": ["gautam adani", "adani group", "ambuja cement", "orient cement"], "tags": [], "article_images": "https://www.theweek.in/content/dam/week/week/news/biz-tech/images/2024/10/22/ambuja-cement.jpg", "all_images": ["https://img.theweek.in/etc.clientlibs/theweek/global-clientlibs/clientlibs-general/resources/images/week-default.jpg", "https://img.theweek.in/etc.clientlibs/theweek/global-clientlibs/clientlibs-general/resources/images/placeholder-img.png", "https://img.theweek.in/content/dam/week/week/news/biz-tech/images/2024/10/22/ambuja-cement.jpg", "https://img.theweek.in/content/dam/week/logo/The-Week-Logo-Big.png", "https://certify.alexametrics.com/atrk.gif?account=feCLu1WyR620WR", "https://www.theweek.in/content/dam/week/week/news/biz-tech/images/2024/10/22/ambuja-cement.jpg"], "article_metadata": {"robots": "index,archive,follow", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0 user-scalable=yes", "theme-color": "#d30e15", "description": "Orient Cement acquisition will help Ambuja reach 100 MTPA cement capacity in the current financial year", "keywords": "gautam adani, adani group, ambuja cement, orient cement", "og": {"tags": "gautam adani, adani group, ambuja cement, orient cement", "title": "Adani-owned Ambuja acquires Orient Cement stake from CK Birla Group", "description": "Orient Cement acquisition will help Ambuja reach 100 MTPA cement capacity in the current financial year", "type": "article", "image": "https://www.theweek.in/content/dam/week/week/news/biz-tech/images/2024/10/22/ambuja-cement.jpg", "site_name": "The Week", "url": "https://www.theweek.in/news/biz-tech/2024/10/22/adani-owned-ambuja-acquires-orient-cement-stake-from-ck-birla-group.html"}, "news_keywords": "gautam adani, adani group, ambuja cement, orient cement", "twitter": {"title": "Adani-owned Ambuja acquires Orient Cement stake from CK Birla Group", "description": "Orient Cement acquisition will help Ambuja reach 100 MTPA cement capacity in the current financial year", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@theweek", "image": {"src": "https://www.theweek.in/content/dam/week/week/news/biz-tech/images/2024/10/22/ambuja-cement.jpg"}, "url": "https://www.theweek.in/news/biz-tech/2024/10/22/adani-owned-ambuja-acquires-orient-cement-stake-from-ck-birla-group.html"}, "fb": {"app_id": 853383434707724, "pages": 108327375932236}}, "ambuja_kawach_count": 0, "ambuja_cool_walls_count": 0, "ambuja_compocem_count": 0, "ultratech_weather_pro_flex_count": 0, "shree_aac_blocks_count": 0, "ambuja_plus_count": 0, "ultratech_flex_count": 0, "shree_adhesives_count": 0},

The acquisition is expected to close within three to four months, subject to regulatory approvals.\n\nKaran Adani, Director of Ambuja Cements, noted that this acquisition positions the company to reach 100 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) in cement capacity by the end of the fiscal year. \"This will help expand Adani Cements' presence in core markets and improve its pan-India market share by 2%,\" he added.\n\nOrient Cement currently operates with an 8.5 million tonnes annual capacity, and an additional ready-to-implement capacity of 8.1 MTPA across Telangana, Karnataka, and Maharashtra. This acquisition will drive Ambuja’s target of exceeding 100 MTPA by 2025 and 140 MTPA by 2028.\n\nMarket analyst Sunny Agarwal from SBICAP Securities highlighted the positive impact of the deal on both parties, noting that the acquisition price benefits Orient Cement shareholders, while Ambuja gains a foothold in the southern market. \"Consolidation in the cement sector is well underway,\" he said.", "source_link": "https://www.businesstoday.in/latest/corporate/story/gautam-adanis-ambuja-expands-empire-with-rs-8100-crore-orient-cement-acquisition-451012-2024-10-22", "keywords": ["adani group", "adani shares", "adani stocks", "gautam adani", "ambuja cements", "orient cement"], "tags": [], "article_images": "https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/businesstoday/images/story/202410/67175cef448c5-the-deal-values-orient-cements-operational-and-ready-to-implement-capacity-at-58-per-tonne--signif-220601558-16x9.png", "all_images": ["https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/businesstoday/resource/img/bt_lgo_icon.svg", "https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/businesstoday/resource/img/logo/horizontal-mindrush.jpg", "https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/businesstoday/resource/img/bt-adani-new.png", "https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/sites/mailer/rss-icon.png", "https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/sites/mailer/bt-text-img.png", "https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/businesstoday/resource/img/rhs_market_today.svg", "https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/businesstoday/resource/img/bt_pwa_35x19.png", "https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/businesstoday/resource/img/bt_business_today_logo.png", "https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/businesstoday/resource/zero-mile-samvad-iim-nagpur-microsite/img/zms-logo.jpg", "https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/businesstoday/resource/img/mpw-new.png", "https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/businesstoday/2023-04/logo.png?size=45:45", "https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/businesstoday/resource/img/evt_lgo_best_school.png", "https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/businesstoday/resource/img/tech-today-logo-07112023.png", "https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/businesstoday/company-img/ambujacem_93575841891_218.png", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=8549097&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/businesstoday/images/story/202410/67175cef448c5-the-deal-values-orient-cements-operational-and-ready-to-implement-capacity-at-58-per-tonne--signif-220601558-16x9.png", "https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/businesstoday/resource/img/bt-pwc-new.png", "https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/businesstoday/resource/img/ttl_icn_bttv.svg", "https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/businesstoday/resource/img/logo/davos_15012025.png", "https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/businesstoday/images/story/202410/67175cef448c5-the-deal-values-orient-cements-operational-and-ready-to-implement-capacity-at-58-per-tonne--signif-220601558-16x9.png?size=948:533", "https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/sites/mailer/youtube-icon.png", "https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/businesstoday/resource/img/economic-indicators.svg", "https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/businesstoday/resource/img/bt500-wealth-creators.jpg", "https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/businesstoday/resource/img/best-bank-new.png", "https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/businesstoday/resource/img/bt-500-new.png", "https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/businesstoday/resource/img/eveconomics_new_18.png", "https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/businesstoday/resource/img/bt-accenture-new.png", "https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/businesstoday/resource/adani-bribery-scandal-the-breakdown/img/Logo-unit-horizontal.jpg", "https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com//businesstoday/resource/img/bt_ttl_icn.svg"], "article_metadata": {"theme-color": "#E1F4FD", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=5.0", "language": "en", "dc.language": "en", "csrf-token": "hteidDnvzEpMO6kHAnvBWl1rGYNBVz0qgAaqjvIx", "keywords": "adani group, adani shares, adani stocks, gautam adani, ambuja cements, orient cement", "news_keywords": "adani group, adani shares, adani stocks, gautam adani, ambuja cements, orient cement", "description": "The deal values Orient Cement’s operational and ready-to-implement capacity at $58 per tonne, significantly lower than the greenfield set-up cost of $110-120 per tonne.

The purchase of shares at a price of Rs 395.4 per share from the promoters of Orient Cement and certain public shareholders will be the means by which the agreement is carried out.\n\nAccording to a stock exchange statement by the Adani group firm, the transaction will be completed in two phases: Ambuja Cements would purchase 37.9% from the promoters of Orient Cement and an additional 8.9% from specific public shareholders. Ambuja intends to next initiate an open offer for 26% of the increased share capital of Orient Cement at the same price per share.\n\nWith 8.5 MTPA already in operation and an additional 8.1 MTPA in development, this acquisition will increase Ambuja’s cement capacity to 16.6 MTPA.\n\nThe share price of Ambuja Cements was up 0.6% from the previous close, trading in the green at Rs 575.15 on the NSE. However, following yesterday’s 6% rise, the share price of Orient Cement dropped by about 1% to Rs 347.\n\nThe agreement moves Ambuja one step closer to its long-term objective of reaching 140 MTPA of cement capacity by 2028, with a target of over 100 MTPA by FY25. Additionally, it claimed that Orient Cement’s limestone reserves in Rajasthan allow Ambuja to potentially expand its capacity in North India by 6 MTPA.\n\nThe acquisition is a component of Ambuja Cements’ fast growth strategy, according to director Karan Adani, who noted, “By acquiring Orient Cement, Ambuja is well-positioned to reach 100 MTPA cement capacity in FY25.”\n\nAmita Birla voiced confidence in the deal’s long-term advantages for stakeholders and employees, while CK Birla, the promoter of Orient Cement, stated that the group’s objective is to reallocate money to focus on consumer-centric and technology-driven enterprises.\n\nAmbuja will keep its debt-free position by paying for the acquisition exclusively with internal accruals. Ambuja’s current footprint will be enhanced by Orient Cement’s strategic assets, which include its operational plants in Telangana, Karnataka, and Maharashtra. This would lower logistics costs and increase overall market share by 2% throughout India.\n\nDiscover the next big investment!

ET was the first to report about these developments in editions dated October 18, 2022 and July 4th.Jindal’s attempt to throw a hat in the ring for OCL’s 8.5 million tonnes per annum capacity will see the entry of a third contender in the race following Gautam Adani and Kumar Mangalam Birla, both of whom has been in active discussions with Delhi-based CK Birla, Kumar Mangalam’s uncle, at various points since late last year ever since JP Morgan begun a sale process. In 2022, all three went head-to-head for the $6.5 billion acquisition of Holcim’s India assets -- biggest M&A in India’s building-materials industry – in which Adani eventually trumped the other two to overnight emerge as the 2nd largest player in the country, upending the pecking order. Since then, the two have acquired seven companies between them.The promoter stake in Orient Cement - held by the Birla family and private investment vehicles - is 37.9%. An acquisition will also trigger an open offer for an additional 26% stake from minority shareholders. But OCL’s shares have appreciated 56% in 3 months in anticipation of a trade as CK Birla’s second generation is believed to not interested in running the business. At current market prices a transaction for the 63.9% could be as much as Rs 4546.54 crore. OCL’s current market value is Rs 7115.09 crore.With Adani and Ultratech negotiations dragging on valuations and environmental clearance of key limestone mines, Jindal saw an opportunity to also join the fray as in the last one month when both Adani and Birla turned their focus down south with the former acquiring Penna Cement in June. Within days, Ultratech bought into India Cements , acquiring a minority stake, before ramping it up to a majority control last Sunday.“JSW have been keen to acquire Heidelburg's India assets, Penna and India Cement. Heidelburg has been insisting on an equal joint venture, while in Penna, they were in fact about to initiate due diligence when Adani leapfrogged ahead,” said a person aware of the ongoing negotiations. “Orient is also a medium scale asset and have been under their radar for a while once the sale process was launched. But the efforts have intensified in the last few weeks following the India Cements transaction.”JSW Cement has been planning to list its cement business next year. An acquisition of OCL will also help it to reverse merge and get listed in the process.Mails, calls and messages to CK Birla, chairman of the eponymous group and Deepak Khetrapal, MD and CEO of OCL remained unanswered. JSW spokesperson declined to comment.There is still no guarantee that these discussions with lead to a transaction, warned the people mentioned above. “The shopping spree has become so intense that it is now a seller’s market,” said a CEO of a rival cement company. “Birla will sell to the highest bidder extracting maximum value.” OCL has a limestone mine of 8 MTPA that could help new suitors to take capacity to 16 MTPA.” In 2018 Orient Cement declared intentions to double its capacity with an investment of Rs 2000 crore based on the supply contract of limestone from Telengana State Mineral Development Corporation (TSMDC). Subsequently in its FY23 annual report, the company mentioned the reopening of its Rajasthan mines and its intention to enter Northern Indian markets with a greenfield capacity of over 3MTPA diversifying its geographical reach to mitigate risks. This strategic direction has contributed to it commanding a higher valuation compared to standalone regional cement companies.According to sector analysts, Orient Cement promoters would be looking at valuations better than India Cements as their assets and balance sheet is superior compared to the southern players that got acquired in recent months. Penna’s sale of 12 MTPA translates to a valuation of $88/tonne and India Cements (14.5 MTPA) deal took place in two tranches between $93/tonne and $112 per tonnes.Orient Cement is already trading at $100 EV per ton based on the current installed capacity. It is nearly debt free company with debt-to-equity ratio of just 0.07 at the FY24.The company achieved 81% utilization in the fourth quarter, with sequential sales volume growth of 24% with increased focus on increasing the proportion of premium cement sales, which accounted for 22% of total volume in FY24, up from 14% in the previous fiscal year.“OCL’s asking valuation should be more than $110-112 EV per ton that would translate into market cap of around Rs 8100 crore compared,” said another person familiar on condition of anonymity as the talks are in private domain.JSW Cement has a current capacity of 16.6 MTPA with units in Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka but has aggressive plans to touch 26 MTPA by FY26 and 50 MTPA by 2030 through a combination of greenfield and brownfield expansion.OCL’s manufacturing footprint spans across Devpur (Telangana), Jalgaon (Maharashtra), and Chittpur (Karnataka), but it supplies to 11 states across Central, Western, and Southern India. A significant portion of its sales originates from the Vidarbha and Marathwada regions of Maharashtra and Telangana. Western India contributes 67% to total sales, followed by South India at 24%, down from 27%, with the remaining from Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh. A successful acquisition would therefore help ramping up capacity in complimentary markets as well as improve market share in some of its existing markets, feels industry players. Orient Cement has outlined a capital expenditure of Rs 1000 crore for the current fiscal year, with expansion plans at its Telangana and Karnataka plants.", "source_link":

Initially, Ambuja Cements will acquire a 46.80% stake in Orient Cement, comprising a 37.90% stake from the current promoters and an additional 8.90% from public shareholders.\n\nUnder SEBI’s Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers (SAST) rules, this share acquisition triggers a mandatory open offer for an additional 26% of Orient Cement’s expanded share capital. If the open offer is fully accepted, Ambuja Cements would hold up to 72.8% of Orient Cement.\n\nIn October, the Adani Group announced a binding agreement to acquire Orient Cement at an equity value of Rs 8,100 crore, adding 16.6 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) capacity to Adani Cement, which operates in the industry through Ambuja Cements. Ambuja currently operates 22 integrated plants, 10 bulk terminals, and 21 grinding units across India.\n\nOrient Cement has manufacturing facilities in Telangana, Karnataka, and Maharashtra, with distribution in 10 states. Ambuja has asserted that the acquisition poses no competition risks, as CCI evaluates relevant markets, including grey cement production and sale in Telangana, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, and Gujarat.\n\nAdditionally, CCI noted minor vertical links in services such as limestone, fly ash, clinker, and ready-mix concrete related to cement manufacturing, which Ambuja and Orient Cement believe present no competitive concerns. Earlier this year, Adani Group also acquired Penna Cement for Rs 10,422 crore, adding 14 MTPA to its capacity, solidifying its position as the country’s second-largest cement manufacturer.\n\nAmbuja Cements Limited, a leading cement company in India and part of the Adani Group, which is known for its rapidly growing portfolio of diversified sustainable businesses, has played a significant role in shaping the Indian cement industry.\n\nWith its subsidiaries, Ambuja Cements has helped increase the Adani Group’s cement capacity to 89 MTPA, supported by 22 integrated manufacturing plants and 21 grinding units across the country. Recognized as one of ‘India’s Most Trusted Cement Brands’ by TRA Research in the Brand Trust Report 2024 and among ‘Iconic Brands of India’ by The Economic Times, Ambuja is known for its innovative, sustainable home-building solutions and eco-friendly practices.\n\nThe company pioneered a captive port with ten terminals, ensuring cost-effective and timely shipments of bulk cement. Its sustainable product range is also included in the GRIHA product catalogue, helping customers reduce their carbon footprints.\n\nA leader in sustainable business practices, Ambuja Cements is ranked among ‘India’s Top 50 companies contributing to inclusive growth’ by SKOCH and has received an A- ‘Leadership Score’ by CDP for its efforts in climate change mitigation.", "source_link": "https://themachinemaker.com/news/ambuja-cements-seeks-cci-approval-for-acquisition-of-orient-cement/", "keywords": [""], "tags": ["CCI", "MANUFACTURING", "ORIENT CEMENT", "AMBUJA CEMENT"], "article_images": "https://themachinemaker.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/ambuja-cement.jpg", "all_images": ["https://themachinemaker.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/ambuja-cement.jpg", "https://themachinemaker.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/altair_newsroom_pr_future-industry-2025_social-1-1024x683.jpg", "https://themachinemaker.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/machinemaker_fav.jpeg", "https://themachinemaker.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/MM_white_black-3.png", "https://themachinemaker.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/cropped-machinemaker-ani-logo-1-2.gif", "https://themachinemaker.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Greenline-1024x682.jpg", "https://themachinemaker.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/machinemaker-ani-logo-1-2.gif", "https://themachinemaker.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Happy-Forging-1024x684.jpg", "https://themachinemaker.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Vedanta-Aluminium-Unveils-AI-Powered-Drone-for-Enhanced-Mine-Safety-2-1024x683.jpg", "https://themachinemaker.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Image1-1-1024x683.jpg"], "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, viewport-fit=cover", "description": "Ambuja Cements, part of Gautam Adani’s Adani Group, has applied for approval from the Competition Commission of India (CCI) to acquire a majority stake in CK Birla Group’s Orient Cement Ltd in a transaction valued at Rs 8,100 crore.

The acquisition will add 16.6 MTPA (million tonne per annum) capacity to Adani Cement , which operates through Ambuja Cements in the sector.Ambuja Cements, the cement and building material company of Adani Cement and is a part of the diversified Adani Group. It operates 22 integrated cement plants across India, as well as 10 bulk cement terminals and 21 grinding units.Orient Cement has three manufacturing facilities in Telangana, Karnataka and Maharashtra, with distribution in 10 states across India.Further, Ambuja Cements said that the proposed acquisition of Orient Cement by Ambuja Cements does not pose any competition concerns, allowing the CCI the flexibility to keep market definitions open.For its assessment, however, CCI has outlined two relevant markets such as a broad market covering grey cement manufacture and sale in Telangana, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, and Gujarat, and a narrower market focused on Telangana, Maharashtra, and Karnataka.The parties (Ambuja and Orient Cement) have also identified certain insignificant existing and potential vertical linkages and supply arrangements pertaining to products/ services such as limestone, fly ash, clinker, coal management services, ready mix concrete and provision of construction activities, which is linked to the market for manufacture of cement.These vertical linkages do not give rise to any competition concerns whatsoever, they added.In June this year, Adani had announced the acquisition of Hyderabad-based Penna Cement at an enterprise value of Rs 10,422 crore, which added 14 MTPA capacity to the country's second largest manufacturer.", "source_link": "https://infra.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/construction/ambuja-cements-seeks-cci-nod-to-acquire-majority-stake-in-orient-cement/115197753", "keywords": ["Ambuja

(Image: Ambuja Cement/ET NOW News)\n\nAmbuja Cement-Orient Cement acquisition : Ambuja Cements is set to acquire a 46.8% stake in Orient Cement Limited (OCL), which will trigger an open offer to buy an additional 26% of shares from public shareholders. The deal values OCL at Rs 8,100 crores, or Rs 395.40 per share, and will be fully funded through internal resources, the Adani Group cement-maker informed the bourses on Tuesday, October 22.\n\nThe acquisition includes 8.5 million tons per annum (MTPA) of operational cement capacity and 8.1 MTPA of projects ready to start. Further, as per the company's investor presentation, a high-quality limestone mine in Chittorgarh, Rajasthan, can support an extra 6.0 MTPA of cement capacity in North India.\n\nWith this acquisition, Adani Cement's total operational capacity will rise to 97.4 MTPA, moving closer to their goal of exceeding 100 MTPA by March 2025.\n\n\"This timed acquisition marks another significant step forward in Ambuja Cements’ accelerated growth journey, increasing cement capacity by ~30 MTPA within two years of Ambuja’s acquisition,\" said Karan Adani, Director of Ambuja Cements.\n\n\"By acquiring OCL, Ambuja is poised to reach 100 MTPA cement capacity in FY 25. The acquisition will help to expand Adani Cement’s presence in core markets and improve its pan-India market share by 2%. OCL’s assets are highly efficient, equipped with railway sidings and well supported by captive power plants, renewable energy, WHRS and AFR facilities. OCL’s strategic locations, high-quality limestone reserves and requisite statutory approvals present an opportunity to increase cement capacity in the near term to 16.6 MTPA,\" he added.\n\nCK Birla, Chairman of Orient Cement and the CK Birla Group, said, \"The CK Birla Group is continuously reallocating capital to sharpen its focus on consumer centric, technology driven and service based businesses. I take pride in Orient Cement’s impressive track record of building premium brands and maintaining a leading market share in the geographies it operates in. We are confident that the Adani Group, with its strong focus on cement and infrastructure, is the ideal new owner to drive continued growth at Orient Cement for our people and stakeholders.\"\n\nOrient Cement is almost debt free, Ambuja Cement s mentioned in its presentation.

The transaction, valued at INR 8,100 crore, or INR 395.40 per share, has triggered an open offer for an additional 26 per cent stake from public shareholders, marking a pivotal moment in the Indian cement industry. This acquisition will be entirely funded through internal accruals and brings with it a substantial addition to Ambuja Cement's capacity. Orient Cement's operational assets include 8.5 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) of cement capacity, with 8.1 MTPA of ready-to-execute projects in the pipeline. Furthermore, the high-quality limestone reserves in Chittorgarh, Rajasthan, offer the potential to increase grinding capacity by an additional 6 MTPA, strengthening Ambuja's position in the northern Indian market.\n\nWith this acquisition, Ambuja Cements will enhance its total operational capacity to 97.4 MTPA, fast-tracking its goal to achieve over 100 MTPA by March 2025. The strategic move also aligns with Ambuja's long-term target of reaching 140 MTPA by 2028. The acquisition of OCL is expected to yield multiple operational synergies.\n\nOrient Cement's efficient operations complement Ambuja Cements' existing assets, providing immediate opportunities for scaling, improving capacity utilization and optimizing logistics. For instance, clinker rail freight costs for the Jalgaon grinding unit (GU) are anticipated to reduce by approximately INR 150 per tonne due to clinker source swapping with Adani Cement's current network. This acquisition also supports Ambuja's strategy of cost leadership through logistics optimization and increased green power use.\n\n\"This timed acquisition marks another significant step forward in Ambuja Cements' accelerated growth journey, increasing cement capacity by ~30 MTPA within two years of Ambuja's acquisition,\" said Karan Adani, Director of Ambuja Cements.\n\nMoreover, Ambuja Cements will significantly boost its presence in South and West India, expanding its market share by approximately 2 per cent. The combination of both brands—Ambuja and ACC—will likely drive increased trade sales, higher realizations, and the sale of premium cement, with projections pointing towards sustainable EBITDA levels exceeding INR 1,500 per tonne by FY28.\n\nThis acquisition further strengthens Ambuja's position as a key player in the Indian cement industry and is expected to deliver a return on capital employed (ROCE) of more than 15 per cent. With a target to ramp up capacity utilization to 85 per cent within three years, the deal represents a major step toward Ambuja Cement's journey of operational efficiency and market expansion, while accelerating its goal to become a 100+ MTPA player by 2025.", "source_link": "https://www.entrepreneur.com/en-in/news-and-trends/ambuja-cements-to-acquire-468-stake-in-orient-cement/481666",

This acquisition is aimed at strengthening Ambuja’s position in the cement market and accelerating its growth trajectory towards achieving a cement capacity of over 100 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) by FY 2025. The acquisition will be financed through internal accruals, ensuring that Ambuja remains debt-free.\n\nAmbuja Cements Director Karan Adani commented on the acquisition: “This acquisition is a crucial step in our journey to expand our footprint in the cement industry. By adding OCL’s capacity, we are set to achieve our goal of 100 MTPA by FY 2025. This deal not only boosts our presence in core markets but also increases our national market share by 2%. OCL’s strategic locations, efficient plants, and robust infrastructure provide an excellent opportunity for future growth.”\n\nOCL currently operates with a clinker capacity of 5.6 MTPA and cement capacity of 8.5 MTPA across its plants in Telangana, Karnataka, and Maharashtra. The company has additional capacity ready for expansion, with the ability to increase clinker capacity by 6.0 MTPA and cement capacity by 8.1 MTPA. Moreover, OCL has a valuable limestone mining lease in Rajasthan’s Chittorgarh region, which presents an opportunity for setting up additional capacity in North India.\n\nCK Birla, Chairman of Orient Cement and the CK Birla Group, expressed confidence in the transaction, stating, “We have built a strong brand with a significant market presence, and I am confident that under Adani’s leadership, Orient Cement will continue to grow and thrive. This acquisition aligns with our strategy of focusing on consumer-centric and technology-driven businesses.”\n\nCo-Chairperson of the CK Birla Group, Amita Birla, also highlighted the importance of sustainability in OCL’s operations: “Sustainability has always been a core part of our business model, and I believe Adani Cement will be the right partner to further this legacy, benefiting both our employees and customers.”\n\nIn addition to its cement operations, OCL has invested in renewable energy, including a 10 MW waste heat recovery system (WHRS) and a 33 MW renewable energy setup, contributing to the company’s sustainability efforts. Recent projects, such as the commissioning of a WHRS in Chittapur and ongoing solar power projects, demonstrate the company’s commitment to green energy initiatives.\n\nThe acquisition is expected to create synergies between Ambuja and OCL, enhancing efficiency in logistics, reducing costs, and optimizing capacity utilization. This deal marks another significant step for the Adani Group in expanding its cement business, following earlier acquisitions and expansion efforts.", "source_link": "https://www.punekarnews.in/adani-group-acquires-orient-cement-for-rs-8100-crore-expands-cement-capacity/", "keywords": [""], "tags": [], "article_images": "http://www.punekarnews.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/1559808037103_Business-1-1024x421.jpg", "all_images": ["https://www.punekarnews.in/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Jitendra-Dudi--300x171.jpg", "https://www.punekarnews.in/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/CEO-Deepinder-Goyal-300x207.jpeg", "https://www.punekarnews.in/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/German-Bakery-Blast-300x171.jpg", "https://www.punekarnews.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/1559808037103_Business-1-1024x421-1024x421.jpg", "http://www.punekarnews.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/1559808037103_Business-1-1024x421.jpg", "https://www.punekarnews.in/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/How-to-Calculate-EMI-and-Interest-Rate-of-Your-Loan-300x174.jpeg", "https://www.punekarnews.in/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Rushiraj-Sawant-300x171.jpg", "https://www.punekarnews.in/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Insurance-Plan-In-India--300x140.png", "https://www.punekarnews.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Devendra-Fadnavis--300x171.jpg", "https://www.punekarnews.in/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/ST-Bus-300x171.jpg", "https://www.punekarnews.in/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/cropped-Punekarnews.png"], "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Business - Adani Group Acquires Orient Cement for Rs 8,100 Crore, Expands Cement Capacity", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Adani Group Acquires Orient Cement for Rs 8,100 Crore, Expands Cement Capacity - Punekar News", "description": "Business - Adani Group Acquires Orient Cement for Rs 8,100 Crore, Expands Cement Capacity", "url": "https://www.punekarnews.in/adani-group-acquires-orient-cement-for-rs-8100-crore-expands-cement-capacity/", "site_name": "Punekar News", "image": {"identifier": "http://www.punekarnews.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/1559808037103_Business-1-1024x421.jpg", "width": 1024, "height": 421, "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/punekarnews/", "published_time": "2024-10-22T05:17:34+00:00"}, "author": "Reporter", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@punekarnews", "site": "@punekarnews", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "Reporter", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "3 minutes"}, "generator": "Site Kit by Google 1.136.0", "google-site-verification": "fFsgejvjDqYlPpZJqXggNq2ifuiN0PFl_YL2jIPoniY", "google-adsense-platform-account": "ca-host-pub-2644536267352236", "google-adsense-platform-domain": "sitekit.withgoogle.com", "onesignal": "wordpress-plugin", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.punekarnews.in/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/cropped-Punekar-News-logo41-270x270.png", "numberOfItems": 3, "itemListOrder": "Ascending"}, "ambuja_kawach_count": 0, "ambuja_cool_walls_count": 0, "ambuja_compocem_count": 0, "ultratech_weather_pro_flex_count": 0, "shree_aac_blocks_count": 0, "ambuja_plus_count": 0, "ultratech_flex_count": 0, "shree_adhesives_count": 0},

The Ambuja cement is buying the stake for Rs 3,791 crore. The deal will surpass UltraTech Cement, owned by Kumar Mangalam Birla and will make Adani’s company the largest cement producer. As required, Ambuja will buy an additional stake of 26% from Orient cement’s public shareholders for Rs 2,112 crore. This will be Ambuja’s fifth purchase after Adani took over it in Sept 2022. Previously Ambuja purchased the Hyderabad-based Penna Cement in June.\n\nNot only Ambuja cement, UltraTech and JSW Cement were also had an eye on Orient cement. Orient Cement is an attractive purchase due to its low production costs, minimal debt, and potential for growth. Its capacity can be doubled to 17 million tonnes and it owns a limestone mine in Rajasthan for future expansion. It has plants in Telangana, Karnataka, and Maharashtra. After buying, Ambuja will gain 3 new plants\n\nand 7.5 million tonnes annual production capacity. It will increase Ambuja’s production capacity and expand it’s presence in South India. Total capacity of Ambuja Cement for now is, 97 million tonnes. It aims to fulfill the target of 140 million tonnes by 2028. Similarly, UltraTech currently has a capacity of over 180 million tonnes and it aims to reach 200 million tonnes by 2027.\n\nThe Chandra Kant Birla group is selling the Orient Cement to focus on priority business. He currently has 50 clinics across India. He is planning to expand his healthcare business with two fertility chain acquisitions. In March, the group acquired a well-known pipes and fittings brand in East India named Topline to to strengthen its home and building materials portfolio.\n\nCK Birla the chairman of CK Birla groups, praised Adani Group. He said, he have immense faith in Adani’s ability to drive growth at Orient Cement. “We are confident that the Adani Group, with its strong focus on cement and infrastructure, is the ideal new owner to drive continued growth at Orient Cement for our people and stakeholders,” he said.\n\nReportedly, Ambuja is purchasing the Orient Cement by it’s own funds of Rs 23,000 crore. The fund is being provided by Adani. The business deal will help Ambuja in expanding it’s cement production, reducing transportation costs and increasing market share. Ambuja expects its market share to increase by 2 per cent following the Orient deal, and will pay Rs 395.4 per share of the target company.", "source_link": "https://kalingatv.com/business/ambuja-cements-to-buy-orient-cement-boosts-capacity-expands-south-india-presence/", "keywords": [""], "tags": ["Om Birla", "Adani Group", "Business News", "Gautam Adani"], "article_images": "https://kalingatv.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Ambuja-Cements.gif", "all_images": ["https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7a48bf1bdd37bc6490052f9883d779f2?s=26&d=mm&r=g", "https://kalingatv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Ktv-Logo_.png", "https://kalingatv.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Ambuja-Cements.gif", "https://kalingatv.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ios-store.png", "https://kalingatv.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Television-Partner.png", "https://kalingatv.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/android-store.png", "https://kalingatv.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/whatsapp-subscribe.png"], "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Gautam Adani's Ambuja cements is all set to buy 47%  stake of Orient Cement from Chandra Kant Birla's family", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Ambuja Cements to buy Orient Cement: boosts capacity, expands South India presence", "description": "Mumbai: Billionaire Gautam Adani's Ambuja cements is all set to buy 47%  stake of Orient Cement from Chandra Kant Birla's family.

This takes full year profitability to Rs5.5bn (EPS Rs28.31, up 25% YoY) as compared to profit of Rs4.4bn (EPS Rs22.67) in the SPLY. Impact In 4QFY24, the company's local dispatches reached 0.52 million tons, remaining flat QoQ, but recorded a decline of 6% YoY as compared to 0.55 million tons in SPLY. During 4QFY24, CHCC reported net sales revenue of Rs9.5Bn, showcasing a jump of 10% as against Rs8.6Bn in SPLY. Surge in revenue is mainly because of price increases given total dispatches remained flat. Net revenue were in line with our expectations. Gross margins settled at 28.15% in 4QFY24, lower than our expectations. The deviation could be on account of fuel cost, in our view. Moreover, higher effective tax rate of 61% in 4QFY24 eroded the bottom line wherein if we normalize it, the earnings broadly came in line with our estimates.

Holcim India CEO, Neeraj Akhoury, also noted that “Ambuja Kawach, our green cement, demonstrated a growth of 22% YoY”.\n\nThis year has also seen increased operating costs for the companies across the board due to increased fuel prices and inflationary pressures, with Ambuja cement’s total operating costs increasing by 27% to INR64.44 billion (US$806 million).\n\nAkhoury commented on this trend, that, “The April to June 2022 quarter was impacted by rising fuel prices and related inflationary impacts. This was partly mitigated by improved efficiencies delivered under our ‘I CAN’ program which continues to deliver strong results.\n\nIn addition, the Master Supply Agreement with ACC also led to strong performance on logistics costs.

Aligned with ‘Net Zero’ target for 2050 with intermediate SBTs for 2030 of parent company Holcim, Ambuja Cement and ACC have undertaken an industry-first approach - leveraging sustainable construction through green products, to reduce CO2 emissions in India.\n\nThrough innovation and R&D, the companies have developed a range of green and responsible products for high-performing and circular construction. These products are giving an impetus to Ambuja Cement and ACC’s contribution towards SDG 9 and 11, our sustainable products will be contributing to the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs).\n\nApproximately 90% of Ambuja Cement’s product portfolio is low carbon fly ash-based PPC and composite cement. Innovative products such as PuraSand, AAC Cool Wall Blocks, Ambuja KAWACH, Ambuja Roof Plus, and Composite Plus, address the sustainability issues in construction. New sustainable product, Ambuja Kawach, is a specially formulated product with high-quality water repellent properties acting as a shield against water seepage in all construction applications (foundation, slab & walls) and ensures that structures can withstand the vagaries of harsh weather. It was certified by an international organisation Solar Impulse Foundation as an efficient solution.\n\nSimilarly, ACC’s low carbon concrete ECOPact has equipped the company to make a positive impact on its community of builders, and eco-conscious Individual Home Builder (IHB). The innovative manufacturing process of the ECOPact reduces CO2 emissions by up to 100%, enhancing the sustainable offerings for the construction industry.\n\n“The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDGs) provide an ambitious and urgent call-to-action and a practical framework for businesses to chart their sustainability journey. At Ambuja Cement and ACC, each sustainability initiative is linked to one or more of the UN SDGs because sustainability is a way of life and hence, we will continue to put in bolder action plans to foster an ecosystem for sustainable construction and circular economy,” said Neeraj Akhoury, CEO India Holcim and MD and CEO of Ambuja Cements Limited.\n\nAdditionally, in line with the UN SDGs, both companies have adopted initiatives that focus on four priority areas, namely Climate and Energy, Circular Economy, Environment, and People and Community.\n\nAmbuja Cement is the only cement company to be certified eight times water positive in the industry. In 2020, Ambuja reduced its specific net CO2 per tonne of cementitious product to 531 kg. To contribute to a circular economy, Ambuja co-processed around 2.75 lakhs tons of waste in its kilns and captive power plants including more than 83,000 tons of plastic waste. Overall, it also consumed about 8 million tonnes of waste derived alternative raw materials such as fly ash, slag, and synthetic gypsum in the manufacturing process.\n\nSimilarly, ACC is the first Indian Cement Company to sign the Net Zero Pledge with Science Based Targets. ACC has its 2030 carbon emission reduction targets endorsed by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). The company has signed the “Business Ambition for 1.5°C” pledge and joined the Race to Zero campaign of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. This makes ACC the first company in the Indian construction sector to sign the “Business Ambition for 1.5°C” commitment with 2030 intermediate targets approved by SBTi.\n\nACC partnered with CDP India's SBTi Incubator Program to develop its science-based targets. ACC’s SBTi approved targets align with the reductions required to limit warming to well below 2°C. ACC Limited commits to reduce scope 1 GHG emissions 21.3% per ton of cementitious material by 2030 from a 2018 base year*. ACC Limited also commits to reduce scope 2 GHG emissions 48.4% per ton of cementitious material within the same timeframe.\n\nBoth companies have also accelerated their de-carbonisation agenda, which aims to generate clean and green energy. The agenda will be delivered through a number of measures, from waste heat recovery system (WHRS) to using more renewable energy and reducing the amount of clinker used in cement manufacturing. These initiatives further strengthen ACC and Ambuja Cement’s solid foundation in sustainability to drive positive change.", "source_link": "https://www.constructionworld.in/resources-company-news/acc-and-ambuja-cement-focus-on-green-and-sustainable-construction--/29402", "keywords": [""], "tags": ["ECOPact", "green and sustainable construction", "United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs)", "natural resources", "de-carbonisation agenda", "parent company- Holcim", "ACC Limited", "‘Net Zero’ Target", "Ambuja Cements Limited", "sustainability"], "article_images": "https://www.constructionworld.in/assets/uploads/s_ad47e7e719da78e4f318d8f04a3ef98d.jpg", "all_images": ["https://www.constructionworld.in/assets/images/register-zephir-bg.jpg", "https://www.constructionworld.in/assets/uploads/657c6d2de06d4c9e345545cb65ac4895.webp", "https://www.constructionworld.in/assets/uploads/100/s_657c6d2de06d4c9e345545cb65ac4895.webp", "https://www.constructionworld.in/assets/images/logo.png", "https://www.constructionworld.in/assets/uploads/100/s_eb9e8aa1327931e181a8848a9da175c1.webp", "https://www.constructionworld.in/assets/uploads/100/s_8a2bc944191ad7a95daad7f2742de8ec.webp", "https://www.constructionworld.in/assets/uploads/100/s_9caa428bf1b8c6e1d8c355379684c59a.webp", "https://www.constructionworld.in/assets/images/videos.png", "https://www.constructionworld.in/assets/images/subscribe.png", "https://www.constructionworld.in/assets/images/our-event.png", "https://www.constructionworld.in/assets/images/top-list.png", "https://www.constructionworld.in/assets/uploads/af23e90ccc21a0fb246a747f0a2135ed.webp", "https://www.constructionworld.in/assets/images/guest-article.png", "https://www.constructionworld.in/assets/uploads/100/s_f25cca6f436f7a42650de75666002607.webp", "https://www.constructionworld.in/assets/images/partner-icon.png", "https://www.constructionworld.in/assets/images/logo-new.webp", "https://www.constructionworld.in/images/crown.png", "https://www.constructionworld.in/assets/images/25-years.png", "https://staging.constructionworld.in/CW-New/images/ad-300x250-2.jpg", "https://www.constructionworld.in/assets/uploads/100/s_862c5e78fcc96dcce8fc4cf5ed5dbf99.webp", "https://www.constructionworld.in/assets/uploads/ad47e7e719da78e4f318d8f04a3ef98d.jpg", "https://www.constructionworld.in/images/Cement-Expo-forum-2025.jpg", "https://www.constructionworld.in/assets/images/home-builder.png", "https://www.constructionworld.in/assets/images/interview.png", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=207622114498187&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://www.constructionworld.in/assets/images/CW-logo-mob.webp", "https://www.constructionworld.in/assets/images/CW-logo-mob.jpg", "https://www.constructionworld.in/assets/images/news.png", "https://www.constructionworld.in/assets/uploads/100/s_a885f996116976a70c5eb0d1cb89ef14.webp", "https://www.constructionworld.in/assets/images/Opinions-icon.png", "https://www.constructionworld.in/assets/images/webinar.png", "https://www.constructionworld.in/assets/uploads/100/s_af23e90ccc21a0fb246a747f0a2135ed.webp", "https://www.constructionworld.in/assets/uploads/a885f996116976a70c5eb0d1cb89ef14.webp", "https://www.constructionworld.in/assets/images/construction-brands.png", "https://www.constructionworld.in/assets/uploads/s_ad47e7e719da78e4f318d8f04a3ef98d.jpg"], "article_metadata": {"facebook-domain-verification": "pukshtzs04ooxthle2sgno2w5c3yw3", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "description": "ACC and Ambuja Cement focus on green and sustainable construction", "og": {"url": "https://www.constructionworld.in/resources-company-news/acc-and-ambuja-cement-focus-on-green-and-sustainable-construction--/29402", "title": "ACC and Ambuja Cement focus on green and sustainable construction", "description": "ACC and Ambuja Cement focus on green and sustainable construction", "type": "article", "image": "https://www.constructionworld.in/assets/uploads/s_ad47e7e719da78e4f318d8f04a3ef98d.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 183566270434437}, "google-signin-client_id": "1052511275237-fqrp7nfmrp5dt7o6i77drh0k3qls5e0f.apps.googleusercontent.com"}, "ambuja_kawach_count": 2, "ambuja_cool_walls_count": 0, "ambuja_compocem_count": 0, "ultratech_weather_pro_flex_count": 0, "shree_aac_blocks_count": 0, "ambuja_plus_count": 0, "ultratech_flex_count": 0, "shree_adhesives_count": 0},

The India Strategy 2025 for both Ambuja and ACC is under execution. Under this plan we will realise industry leading position in cost excellence, asset optimization and sustainability.\n\nOur new Marwar cement plant is now operating at full capacity. Our additional cement capacity expansions of around 9 million tons at Ropar and Bhatapara are on track. Our plan is to grow Cement capacity to 100 million tons per annum.\n\nAmbuja has recorded robust top line growth of 8%. Our market focused strategies are driving this performance. Ambuja Kawach, our green cement, has demonstrated growth of 66% year on year. Ambuja Cements has been ranked as India’s Most Trusted Cement Brand in 2022 by TRA Research.\n\nThe January to March 2022 quarter was impacted by rising fuel prices due to which EBITDA during the quarter was lower by 19%.

The company has stated that this is an innovative green building offering for individual home builders (IHB) in the Thane district.\n\nDeveloped by the company’s in-house team, the product ensures the maintenance of a 5°C temperature difference indoors, no matter how hot or cold the external temperature is. Embedding ‘heat barrier technology’, the product features keep the indoors of houses warm during the winter and cool during the summer. It is a greener alternative, made of aerated autoclaved concrete blocks, and it is stronger than other ordinary bricks. Ambuja Cement is among the first cement companies to offer this kind of unique masonry solution, addressing the needs of what the company calls the diverse and disorganised IHB segment.\n\nThe launch in the Thane district follows the product’s introduction at Nagpur in Maharashtra and select markets in Gujarat, Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, and Chhattisgarh, where it has been gaining in popularity. The product is now available in different parts of the district, including Kalyan, Dombivli, Bhiwandi, and Ulhasnagar, among others.\n\nThe Thane district has a tropical wet and dry climate, and the summer months sometimes record temperatures as high as 41°C. Ambuja Plus Cool Walls prevents the heat from entering into the walls. Likewise, when temperatures drop, this product’s insulating properties keep home interiors warm. The product helps to extend the life of house paint and prevents efflorescence, which is a very common phenomenon with brick walls.\n\nTraditionally, clay brick walls need to be cured – but with heat-resistant concrete blocks and Blockol (block jointing mortar) the product does not require curing, thereby saving large quantities of water during the construction process. It also reduces the hassles faced by the consumer. Other benefits include greater structural stability, speedy and quality construction, wastage control, and the requirement of less manpower.\n\n“Since our inception, innovation has been the hall mark of all our offerings and we have always endeavoured to develop an array of eco-friendly products to ensure a healthier, cleaner, and greener tomorrow, supporting India’s efforts to become a green nation,” said Deepak Mehra, Chief Marketing Officer at Ambuja Cement. “Ambuja Plus Cool Walls reinforces our commitment towards introducing products that deliver high strength and performance, while also integrating sustainability traits. The product gives multiple benefits of superior strength and durability, as well as ensuing ambient temperatures in the house. We are confident that this new product will provide further impetus to the LafargeHolcim Group’s vision.”", "source_link": "https://www.worldcement.com/indian-subcontinent/02042019/ambuja-cement-launches-ambuja-plus-cool-walls/", "keywords": ["Cement News", "Global Cement News", "World Cement News", "International Cement", "World Cement", "Ambuja Cement", "Ambuja Plus Cool Walls", "Thane", "India", "Concrete"], "tags": ["LafargeHolcim news", "Cement news 2018", "India cement news"], "article_images": "https://d23p67eaj7q4a1.cloudfront.net/media/articles/pop/237560.jpg", "all_images": ["https://d23p67eaj7q4a1.cloudfront.net/media/articles/thumb/decarbonisation101.jpg", "https://d1eq5d5e447quq.cloudfront.net/media/free.png", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=778510952260052&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://d23p67eaj7q4a1.cloudfront.net/media/logo.png", "https://bat.bing.com/action/0?ti=5667065&Ver=2", "https://tpc.googlesyndication.com/simgad/15405116606995025670", "https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=5369002&fmt=gif", "https://d23p67eaj7q4a1.cloudfront.net/media/articles/pop/237560.jpg"], "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "description": "Ambuja Cement has launched Ambuja Plus Cool Walls in the Thane district in India.", "keywords": "Cement News, Global Cement News, World Cement News, International Cement, World Cement, Ambuja Cement, Ambuja Plus Cool Walls, Thane, India, Concrete", "robots": "all", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@world_cement", "title": "Ambuja Cement launches Ambuja Plus Cool Walls", "description": "Ambuja Cement has launched Ambuja Plus Cool Walls in the Thane district in India.", "image": {"src": "https://d23p67eaj7q4a1.cloudfront.net/media/articles/pop/237560.jpg"}, "url": "https://www.worldcement.com/indian-subcontinent/02042019/ambuja-cement-launches-ambuja-plus-cool-walls/"}, "og": {"site_name": "World Cement", "title": "Ambuja Cement launches Ambuja Plus Cool Walls", "description": "Ambuja Cement has launched Ambuja Plus Cool Walls in the Thane district in India.", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.worldcement.com/indian-subcontinent/02042019/ambuja-cement-launches-ambuja-plus-cool-walls/", "image": {"identifier": "https://d23p67eaj7q4a1.cloudfront.net/media/articles/pop/237560.jpg", "url": "http://static.worldcement.com/media/articles/pop/237560.jpg", "secure_url": "https://d23p67eaj7q4a1.cloudfront.net/media/articles/pop/237560.jpg", "width": 450, "height": 300}}, "article": {"published_time": "2019-04-02T09:03:00", "section": "Indian Subcontinent", "tag": "Cement news 2018"}}, "ambuja_kawach_count": 0, "ambuja_cool_walls_count": 0, "ambuja_compocem_count": 0, "ultratech_weather_pro_flex_count": 0, "shree_aac_blocks_count": 0, "ambuja_plus_count": 5, "ultratech_flex_count": 0, "shree_adhesives_count": 0},

However, this has an environmental impact, as it uses fertile soil. Also it gives rise to efflorescence on clay brick walls.\n\nAmbuja’s Chief Marketing Officer Sanjay Kumar Gupta said, “Developed by Ambuja’s in-house team, Ambuja Plus Cool Walls is a cleaner and greener offering to the IHB community.

Ambuja Cool Walls are a one-of-a-kind wall solution that keeps the house cool in the summer and retains the inside temperature in the winter, making the home warmer. Ambuja Cements was one of the first cement companies in India to offer this one-of-a-kind block and mortar solution to homebuilders.\n\nAmbuja Cool Walls is a long-lasting product made with cutting-edge heat-barrier technology that outperforms all other products. This product’s ‘heat barrier technology’ helps keep the inside temperature of any house 50 degrees cooler than the outside temperature. The main differentiators of this product are its innovative heat barrier technology, consistent quality, and increased strength.\n\nAmbuja Cool Walls is a novel solution to the problem of non-sustainable building materials in traditional construction. Traditional construction faces problems that traditional structure faces today: efflorescence on walls, termite attack, water absorption, and earthquake proneness. Ambuja Cool Walls, in combination with a special jointing mortar, strengthen the barrier and eliminates the problems associated with traditional construction methods. This saves money for consumers by reducing the cost of electricity due to thermal insulation, reducing the frequency of repeat painting due to no efflorescence, reducing the cost of repeat maintenance, and lowering the cost of construction. Noise reduction, high fire resistance, and other advantages are also available. It also allows for faster construction and a 30 per cent reduction in project completion time.\n\nAmbuja Cool Walls is a green product because it uses a lot of fly ash in its production. The walls do not need to be cured during construction, saving 5000 litres of water for a 1000-square-foot home.\n\n“Ambuja Cements has always pursued innovation to provide customers with eco-friendly solutions for a better and greener future,” said Mr Neeraj Akhoury, CEO of India Holcim and MD & CEO of Ambuja Cements Ltd. It is our goal to provide world-class solutions to Indian customers.

Another man narrates how Khali would occasionally not understand his own strength. It cuts to a scene of him playing with some children. As he's blindfolded and looking for the kids, he bangs his head against the wall, causing it to collapse. Another scene shows Khali breaking a wall while walking backwards. Khali says that the strength that gave him global fame had become a problem at home. Several such instances are featured where Khali causes damage to walls and floors inadvertently. He says that he wished he was built normally, but his mom would always tell him that he was special. Khali explained how these situations carried on and he felt helpless, until his aunt recommended Ambuja Cement. Heeding her advice, he builds his house with Ambuja Cement. The walls stand firm when he runs into them.\n\nBobby Pawar, MD and CCO, Publicis Worldwide South Asia, said, \"Ambuja Cement has been about this giant strength and it has been communicated in previous campaigns. The brief was to do an extension of the giant strength spot. The boys and girls were thinking about this, and this was the coolest idea that popped up. We put one giant's strength against the other. The biggest Indian is The Great Khali. That's where the idea came from. It's a mockumentary on his life.

Adani Group aquires one more enterprise.", "article_body": "Recent Visitors 88\n\nAmbuja Cements Acquires Sanghi Industries\n\nAmbuja Cements Announces Acquisition of Sanghi Industries Strengthening Market Presence: Ambuja’s Strategic Move Sanghi Industries’ Impressive Capabilities and Facilities Ambuja’s Vision: Achieving 140 MTPA Capacity Ahead of Schedule Expanding Cement Capacity: Ambuja’s Next Steps Enhancing Marine Infrastructure: Adani Group’s Strengths Sustainable Transport Solutions for Cost-effective Operations Market Reach and Dealer Network of Sanghi Industries About Ambuja Cements Limited: India’s Leading Cement Company\n\nAhmedabad, 3 August 2023: Ambuja Cements Ltd (ACL), a prominent cement and building material company and part of the Adani Group, has made a significant stride in its growth journey with the announcement of its acquisition of Sanghi Industries Ltd (SIL) at an enterprise value of Rs 5,000 crore. The acquisition, fully funded through internal accruals, will see ACL acquire 56.74% shares of SIL from its existing promoter group, Mr. Ravi Sanghi & family.\n\nStrengthening Market Presence: Ambuja’s Strategic Move\n\nThe acquisition of Sanghi Industries presents a golden opportunity for Ambuja Cements to expand its market presence, fortify its product portfolio, and reinforce its leadership in the construction materials sector. With SIL’s clinker capacity of 6.6 MTPA, cement capacity of 6.1 MTPA, and extensive limestone reserves of 1 billion tonnes, ACL will witness a considerable increase in its cement capacity to 73.6 MTPA.\n\nSanghi Industries’ Impressive Capabilities and Facilities\n\nSIL’s integrated manufacturing unit at Sanghipuram, located in Gujarat’s Kutch district, stands as India’s largest single-location cement and clinker unit by capacity. Boasting two kilns with a clinker production capacity of 6.6 MTPA, a cement grinding unit with a capacity of 6.1 MTPA, a captive power plant of 130 MW, and a Waste Heat Recovery System of 13 MW, SIL’s facilities are both robust and eco-friendly. The unit’s connectivity to a captive jetty at Sanghipuram further adds to its efficiency.\n\nAmbuja’s Vision: Achieving 140 MTPA Capacity Ahead of Schedule\n\nMr. Gautam Adani, Chairman of the Adani Group, expressed his enthusiasm about the acquisition, stating that it aligns perfectly with the Adani Group’s target of achieving 140 MTPA of cement manufacturing capacity by 2028, well ahead of the set timeline. With SIL’s limestone reserves of a billion tonnes, ACL is set to enhance cement capacity at Sanghipuram to 15 MTPA within the next two years. This achievement will expedite Ambuja’s goal of becoming the country’s lowest-cost producer of clinker.\n\nExpanding Cement Capacity: Ambuja’s Next Steps\n\nWith ongoing capital expenditure leading to 14 MTPA capacity and upcoming commissioning of 5.5 MTPA at Dahej and Ametha by Q2 of FY24, the Adani Group’s overall capacity will reach 101 MTPA by 2025. This highlights the strategic importance of the Sanghi Industries acquisition, which propels Ambuja Cements closer to its ambitious goals.\n\nEnhancing Marine Infrastructure: Adani Group’s Strengths\n\nLeveraging the Adani Group’s expertise in building and operating marine infrastructure, the port at Sanghipuram will undergo expansion to handle vessel sizes of 8,000 DWT. Additionally, bulk terminals and grinding units along the western coast will facilitate cost-effective transportation of clinker and cement through the sea route.\n\nSustainable Transport Solutions for Cost-effective Operations\n\nSIL’s existing bulk cement terminals at Navlakhi Port in Gujarat and Dharamtar Port in Maharashtra play a vital role in environment-friendly and competitive transport solutions. The sea route offers efficient transportation for cement shipments, benefiting both the company and the environment.

Ambuja Cement is one of the leading cement manufacturers in India. The enterprise was founded in 1983 and was known as Gujarat Ambuja Cement Limited. The enterprise aims to provide cement and clinker for domestic purposes as well as for export purposes.\n\nThe brand Ambuja Cement has defined standards for the cement industry in India. Contemporaries like Ultra Tech and ACC Cements have been keeping an eye on the industry trend and growth of Ambuja cement and have always tried to do something similar. ACC once was a group of cement manufacturers, but since the separation, the company is on the back foot and ranks behind Ambuja Cement on varied parameters.\n\nAmbuja Cement’s headquarters are in India’s financial capital, Mumbai, Maharashtra. Ambuja Cement is now a part of the global conglomerate Holcim. Holcim has had all the management rights to Ambuja Cement since 2006. Ambuja Cement is also known for its strategic investments in ACC Limited.\n\nAbout Ambuja Cement\n\nType: Cement manufacturing company\n\nCement manufacturing company Industry: Cement\n\nCement Founded: 1983\n\n1983 Founder: Ajit Kerkar\n\nAjit Kerkar Headquarters : Mumbai, India\n\n: Mumbai, India Area served: India\n\nIndia Key people: Gautam Adani (Chairman) and Nishant Ruia (CEO)\n\nGautam Adani (Chairman) and Nishant Ruia (CEO) Number of employees: 24,000\n\nAmbuja Cement Product Strategy\n\nAmbuja Cement manufactures cement and clinkers; the enterprise has close relations with the government and other private institutions. Ambuja is a leading cement manufacturer and has contributed to the rise of infrastructure in the country like never before. By supplying high-quality cement, they have made an incomparable contribution to the country’s development by providing many government projects.\n\nAmbuja Cement has seen varied ups and downs, but they have never compromised on the product quality they produce.\n\nTop products from the house of Ambuja Cement are:\n\nAmbuja Plus Cement\n\nPortland Pozzolana Cement (PPC)\n\nThe Product Mix of Ambuja Cement in 2023 is as follows:\n\nOrdinary Portland Cement (OPC): OPC is a versatile type of cement used in various construction applications, including residential, commercial, and industrial projects. Ambuja Cements produces OPC in different grades to cater to specific requirements. Portland Pozzolana Cement (PPC): PPC is a blended cement that combines OPC and pozzolanic materials like fly ash, making it suitable for infrastructure and large-scale construction projects. It offers improved durability and reduced environmental impact. Ready Mix Concrete (RMC): Ambuja Cements offers ready mix concrete solutions for construction projects, providing customers with a convenient and consistent supply of high-quality concrete mixtures. Specialty Cement Products: Ambuja Cements may also offer specialized cement products designed for specific applications.

Ambuja Cements offers bulk cement delivery options to meet these needs. Value-Added Services: Besides its core product offerings, Ambuja Cements may provide value-added services such as technical support, training, and consulting to assist customers in using their products effectively.\n\nAmbuja Cement Place Strategy\n\nAmbuja Cement was founded on the soil of Gujarat, but the headquarters are in Mumbai. The brand aims to take on its contemporaries in a very unique way. The strong relations with the government and other building institutions have helped Ambuja Cement beat contemporaries like ACC and Ultra Tech. The throat-cutting competition saw a new height when the likes started manufacturing products similar to Ambuja Cement’s.\n\nAmbuja Cement has always believed in rapid expansion; they have monitored their business growth intricately and taken expansion measures whenever the target market requires it. With the expansion through India and its sub-continent, they have developed a good base of users.\n\nAmbuja Cement manufactures cement for two purposes only.\n\nFor domestic use and For exporting it to the world\n\nThe slow but solid expansion has helped the brand create a loyal base that will incur considerable profits in the coming times. The slow and steady expansion has also contributed to the rise in share value.\n\nHere’s a place strategy for Ambuja Cement:\n\nExtensive Distribution Network: Ambuja Cement has established an extensive distribution network of dealers, retailers, and distributors across India. This broad reach ensures that their cement products are readily available to customers in both urban and rural areas. Cement Terminals and Warehouses: The company operates strategically located cement terminals and warehouses to facilitate efficient storage and distribution of cement products. These terminals help reduce transportation costs and ensure a consistent cement supply to construction sites. Direct Sales to Large Customers: Ambuja Cement also directly sells to large construction companies, infrastructure projects, and government agencies. They can cater to bulk orders and specialized requirements by establishing direct relationships with key customers. Digital Presence: In recent years, Ambuja Cement has enhanced its digital presence by offering online platforms and tools. Customers can inquire about products, place orders, and access technical information through the company’s official website and digital applications. Technical Support and Training: Ambuja Cement provides technical support and training to builders, contractors, and masons. They offer expertise in cement applications, construction techniques, and product usage to ensure customers have the necessary knowledge for successful construction projects.\n\nAmbuja Cement Pricing Strategy\n\nThe business development team at Ambuja Cement keeps a meticulous eye on the varied pricing strategies of its contemporaries and competitors. They have worked a way to manage the prices well—Ambuja Cement deals in regular packets of cement, which can be used to build prosperous homes quickly.\n\nAmbuja Cement PPC is available for a meager price of 297 INR. People from the remotest corners of India can buy this cement at the listed price, while international prices will differ based on the taxation rates in the particular country.\n\nCompetitors like ACC and Ultra Tech have listed their products very closely; some have listed their cement packets at 295 and 300 INR. The neck-breaking stiff competition here is taking a toll on almost every enterprise, but Ambuja Cement seems firmly placed and satisfied.\n\nHere’s an analysis of Ambuja Cement’s pricing and distribution strategy:\n\nCost-Plus Pricing: Ambuja Cement typically starts with a cost-plus pricing approach. They calculate their cement products’ production and distribution costs, ensuring that prices cover expenses and contribute to profitability. This forms the foundation of their pricing strategy. Market Segmentation: Ambuja Cement recognizes that different customer segments have varying price sensitivities and requirements. They segment their market into residential, commercial, industrial, and infrastructure segments, tailoring pricing strategies to cater to the specific demands of each sector. Dynamic Pricing: Ambuja Cement employs dynamic pricing strategies in the highly competitive cement industry. They continuously monitor market conditions, demand fluctuations, and competitor pricing, adjusting their prices to remain competitive while preserving margins. Promotional Pricing: Ambuja Cement may offer promotional pricing during specific periods or for certain products to stimulate demand. This can include discounts, bundled offers, or loyalty programs to encourage repeat business. Value-Based Pricing: Beyond considering production costs, Ambuja Cement emphasizes the value its products offer customers. When setting prices, they consider factors like product quality, durability, technical support, and brand reputation. Premium products designed for specialized applications may command higher prices based on the value they provide. Long-Term Contracts: Ambuja Cement may negotiate long-term contracts with fixed or volume-based pricing for large infrastructure projects and bulk buyers. This provides stability and predictability for both the company and its key customers. Transparency: Ambuja Cement maintains its pricing transparency by providing customers with clear pricing structures and terms. This transparency builds trust and fosters long-term relationships. Cost Efficiency and Productivity: The company continuously invests in cost-efficient manufacturing processes and supply chain optimization to manage production costs effectively. These efforts allow Ambuja Cement to offer competitive prices while maintaining profitability.\n\nAmbuja Cement Promotion Strategy\n\nNo other cement manufacturer in the country can even come closer to Ambuja Cement when it comes to marketing the project well. ‘Tutegi Kaise Ambuja Cement Se Jo Bani Hai!’ is one of those rare taglines you will find every kid and oldie chanting. Besides this, the other tagline, “Iss cement mein jaan hai” is synonymous with Ambuja cement and is famous nationwide.\n\nAmbuja Cement not only has a tagline that is easy to remember and addictive but also a series of ad campaigns that aim to touch hearts, from creating ads that showcase the rift between siblings to enrolling the Great Khali for an emotional advertisement.\n\nThe ad that portrayed the famous wrestler Khali is one of the most popular TV ads of recent times. It promotes the product smartly and creates a connection with the people watching.

The company has announced the signing of a definitive agreement to acquire My Home Group's 1.5 MTPA Cement Grinding Unit located in Tuticorin, Tamil Nadu. This strategic move, valued at a noteworthy Rs. 413.75 Crores, is set to bolster Ambuja's presence in the region and fortify its position as a key player in the cement sector.\n\nTuticorin Unit Deal: Ambuja Cements' Strategic Expansion Plan\n\nThe Tuticorin-based grinding unit, situated near the Tuticorin Port, spans across an expansive 61 acres of land.

Additionally, the unit boasts a long-term fly ash supply agreement, ensuring a steady and reliable source of raw materials for cement production.\n\nPrime Location Advantage: Tuticorin Unit Boosts Ambuja's Logistics\n\nOne of the primary motivations behind this acquisition is to leverage the coastal location of the unit to enhance Ambuja's reach in the southern markets of Tamil Nadu and Kerala.

Recently, Pooja SHG, comprised of women from the Dewar community, received a significant order for the supply of 300 tons of plastic waste from Ambuja Cements.\n\nThe Dewar community in Rawan village of Baloda Bazaar Tehsil in Chhattisgarh, has long faced social marginalization and economic hardships, often relying on garbage collection as their main source of income. Ambuja Cement's women empowerment program has played an important role in addressing these challenges, empowering women to generate income through plastic waste collection and linking them with the waste management arm of Ambuja Cements to provide alternate waste.\n\nThis collaborative effort between Ambuja Cements and its waste management arm represents more than just a solution for waste management. It serves as a ray of hope for the Dewar women, offering them opportunities for improved livelihoods and a brighter future through the additional income received. With this support, they can now provide better food, education, and essential resources for their families, facilitating greater integration into mainstream society.\n\nThrough comprehensive training and awareness sessions on income generation and waste management, the Pooja Self Help Group has emerged as a symbol of empowerment within the community. With a renewed focus on personal hygiene and education, there has been a noticeable shift in mindset and behavior among its members.\n\nThe tangible impact of this initiative is evident as the Dewar community now actively seeks employment opportunities beyond traditional avenues and prioritizes education for their children. Economic empowerment has instilled confidence among women, while societal attitudes toward the community have undergone a positive transformation.\n\nAmbuja Cement's role in uplifting the Dewar community highlights its dedication to creating meaningful change in rural areas and driving progress in rural India.", "source_link": "https://www.rprealtyplus.com/press-room/ambuja-cements-csr-support-for-pooja-self-help-group-in-chhattisgarh-114406.html", "keywords": ["Dewar community", "Ambuja Cements", "Adani Group", "income generation", "waste management", "Pooja Self Help Group"], "tags": [], "article_images": "https://storage.googleapis.com/realtyplusmag-news-photo/news-photo/114406.Ambuja-Cements-Drives-Social-Change-by-Empowering-Women-through-Waste-Management.jpg", "all_images": ["https://storage.googleapis.com/realtyplusmag-news-photo/news-photo/118576.South-Africa’s-new-multi-billion-smart-city.jpg", "https://storage.googleapis.com/realtyplusmag-news-photo/news-photo/118715.Realty-firm-Yugen-Infra-to-invest-Rs-2,000-crore-to-develop-villa-projects-in-Goa,-Rs-3,000-crore-topline-expected.jpg", "https://storage.googleapis.com/realtyplusmag-news-photo/news-photo/118577.trump-wh-ap-rc-200703_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "https://storage.googleapis.com/realtyplusmag-news-photo/news-photo/118714.images-(3).png", "https://storage.googleapis.com/realtyplusmag-news-photo/news-photo/album/default-staff.png", "https://storage.googleapis.com/realtyplusmag-news-photo/news-photo/114406.Ambuja-Cements-Drives-Social-Change-by-Empowering-Women-through-Waste-Management.jpg", "https://storage.googleapis.com/realtyplusmag-news-photo/news-photo/epaper/01252025213500-Cover-image---dimension---592-X-774-(1).png", "https://storage.googleapis.com/e4m-news-photo/news-photo/static-images/twitter-logo-large-dark.png", "https://storage.googleapis.com/realtyplusmag-news-photo/news-photo/118757.Supreme-Holdings.jpg", "https://storage.googleapis.com/realtyplusmag-news-photo/news-photo/118578.Naresh-Tyagi,-Chairman-of-the-ICC-National-Expert-Committee-on-Sustainability-and-Chief-Sustainability-Officer,-Aditya-Birla-Fashion-and-Retail-Limited-(1).jpg", "https://www.rprealtyplus.com/img/subscribe-mag.png", "https://storage.googleapis.com/realtyplusmag-news-photo/news-photo/epaper/01072025182910-Cover-image---dimension---592-X-774.png", "https://storage.googleapis.com/realtyplusmag-news-photo/news-photo/newsletter/11182024180946-Realty-Plus---780x90-Pixels.jpg", "https://www.rprealtyplus.com/images/logo.png"], "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "csrf-token": "EIpCctZl4UyDK4EkkZJHySHwsoklSnr1kHhVBYE1", "title": "Ambuja Cements CSR Support For Pooja Self Help Group In Chhattisgarh", "description": "Ambuja Cements CSR Support For Pooja Self Help Group In Chhattisgarh", "keywords": "Dewar community, Ambuja Cements,  Adani Group, income generation, waste management, Pooja Self Help Group", "news_keywords": "Dewar community, Ambuja Cements,  Adani Group, income generation, waste management, Pooja Self Help Group", "image_src": "https://storage.googleapis.com/realtyplusmag-news-photo/news-photo/114406.Ambuja-Cements-Drives-Social-Change-by-Empowering-Women-through-Waste-Management.jpg", "og": {"title": "Ambuja Cements CSR Support For Pooja Self Help Group In Chhattisgarh", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.rprealtyplus.com/press-room/ambuja-cements-csr-support-for-pooja-self-help-group-in-chhattisgarh-114406.html", "site_name": "Realty Plus Magazine", "image": {"identifier": "https://storage.googleapis.com/realtyplusmag-news-photo/news-photo/114406.Ambuja-Cements-Drives-Social-Change-by-Empowering-Women-through-Waste-Management.jpg", "width": 870, "height": 470}, "description": "Ambuja Cements CSR Support For Pooja Self Help Group In Chhattisgarh"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "https://twitter.com/RPRealtyPlus", "creator": "@RPRealtyPlus", "title": "Ambuja Cements CSR Support For Pooja Self Help Group In Chhattisgarh", "image": {"src": "https://storage.googleapis.com/realtyplusmag-news-photo/news-photo/114406.Ambuja-Cements-Drives-Social-Change-by-Empowering-Women-through-Waste-Management.jpg"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/rprealtyplus/"}, "fb": {"app_id": 762410207182368}}, "ambuja_kawach_count": 0, "ambuja_cool_walls_count": 0, "ambuja_compocem_count": 0, "ultratech_weather_pro_flex_count": 0, "shree_aac_blocks_count": 0, "ambuja_plus_count": 0, "ultratech_flex_count": 0, "shree_adhesives_count": 0},

With focus on innovation, digitisation, customer satisfaction, and ESG, our vision drives our expansion into new geographies.

This will be dove-tailed with our ongoing expansion projects, delivering exceptional value for our stakeholders and propelling us towards achieving over 104 MTPA capacity by Q4 FY’25 and 118 MTPA by FY 26.\n\nEfficiency initiatives and investments across all operational areas have shown healthy improvements reinforcing Ambuja’s cost leadership.\n\nIncreased use of low cost Imported Petcoke and efforts to reduce cost of domestic coal (e-auction coal, efficient logistics, group synergies) has helped to reduce kiln fuel cost by 10% from Rs. 1.84 to Rs. 1.66 per ’000 Kcal.\n\nWHRS power share increased by 4.0 pp from 12.6% to 16.6%, Solar power mix increased by 1.9 pp from 2.5% to 4.4%, taking the green power share up by 5.7 pp to 21.5%, clear road map & investment commitments to achieve 60% green power by FY 28.\n\nLogistics costs reduced by 5% @Rs 1,228/ton, driven by efficiency improvement journey (overall lead reducing by 4 km, direct dispatch up by 7 pp @57%). Through various freight negotiation initiatives, road PTPK has decreased by 2% YOY. This is going to be further reduced with roll out of initiatives viz. wheeler rationalisations, BCFC rakes etc.\n\nAmbuja has deployed 5 BCFCM rakes against the order for 26 BCFCM rakes placed earlier for transportation of Dry fly ash.

Typically...", "article_body": "It looks like Ambuja Cements Limited ( ) is about to go ex-dividend in the next three days. Typically, the ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date which is the date on which a company determines the shareholders eligible to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is important as the process of settlement involves two full business days. So if you miss that date, you would not show up on the company's books on the record date. This means that investors who purchase Ambuja Cements' shares on or after the 14th of June will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 26th of July.\n\nThe company's next dividend payment will be ₹2.00 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of ₹2.00 to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Ambuja Cements has a trailing yield of 0.3% on the current stock price of ₹621.30. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. We need to see whether the dividend is covered by earnings and if it's growing.\n\nIf a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. Ambuja Cements paid out just 11% of its profit last year, which we think is conservatively low and leaves plenty of margin for unexpected circumstances. Yet cash flows are even more important than profits for assessing a dividend, so we need to see if the company generated enough cash to pay its distribution. It distributed 43% of its free cash flow as dividends, a comfortable payout level for most companies.\n\nIt's positive to see that Ambuja Cements's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.\n\nClick\n\nHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?\n\nCompanies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. Investors love dividends, so if earnings fall and the dividend is reduced, expect a stock to be sold off heavily at the same time. This is why it's a relief to see Ambuja Cements earnings per share are up 4.8% per annum over the last five years. Recent earnings growth has been limited. However, companies that see their growth slow can often choose to pay out a greater percentage of earnings to shareholders, which could see the dividend continue to rise.\n\nMany investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. Ambuja Cements has seen its dividend decline 5.7% per annum on average over the past 10 years, which is not great to see. Ambuja Cements is a rare case where dividends have been decreasing at the same time as earnings per share have been improving. It's unusual to see, and could point to unstable conditions in the core business, or more rarely an intensified focus on reinvesting profits.\n\nTo Sum It Up\n\nIs Ambuja Cements an attractive dividend stock, or better left on the shelf? Earnings per share growth has been growing somewhat, and Ambuja Cements is paying out less than half its earnings and cash flow as dividends. This is interesting for a few reasons, as it suggests management may be reinvesting heavily in the business, but it also provides room to increase the dividend in time. We would prefer to see earnings growing faster, but the best dividend stocks over the long term typically combine significant earnings per share growth with a low payout ratio, and Ambuja Cements is halfway there. Ambuja Cements looks solid on this analysis overall, and we'd definitely consider investigating it more closely.\n\nWhile it's tempting to invest in Ambuja Cements for the dividends alone, you should always be mindful of the risks involved. To help with this, we've discovered that you should be aware of before investing in their shares.\n\nGenerally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see.

The consumer insight is that at this stage, the house builder is quite anxious and vulnerable and he wants to make sure that his roof is built properly. He doesn’t want to be plagued by problems of a weak or a leaky roof later. Ambuja helps him achieve this with its specially formulated Roof Special cement and the expert services of its Ambuja engineer, both together creating a very strong and leak-proof roof.In any Indian home, the roof or terrace is its mainstay. Be the budding romance with the girl next door, or getting drenched in first rains of the year; the pranks played on the neighbours, or just sitting under the starry sky, looking out on to the horizon, the chhat (terrace/roof) of the house is associated with many unforgettable memories of one’s life, and is therefore, ‘Special’.Building on this insight, Ambuja celebrates these special memories that each of us has, in its new digital campaign, ' What's up on your Chhat ?’, which showcases the special memory of Guptaji , who finds his true love on his chhat. The story follows an endearing couple through the streets of old Ahmedabad, while the husband tries to re-live his fondest memories. Just when the couple reaches their destination, there is an unexpected twist in the story, one that will definitely bring a tear to one’s eye.This story has struck a chord with its audience, as it has crossed 2.5 million views within a week of its launch on the digital platform; it has also been shared more than 12,000 times over Facebook. The campaign also invites the viewers to share their own unforgettable stories that took place on their chhat, with #WhatsUpOnYourChhat.· Client: Ambuja Cement · Digital marketing agency: Experience Commerce · Production house: Mojo Media LLP · Producers: Pooja Kashyap, Vikkas Chopra, Nayan Chandan· Director & Editor : Vipin Parashar· Music Director: Arjunna Harjaie· DOP: Nagaraj M.D.· Story & script: Ullas Chopra", "source_link": "https://brandequity.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/advertising/watch-guptaji-ki-kahaani-in-ambuja-cements-new-ad-campaign/59351568", "keywords": ["Ambuja Cement", "Experience Commerce", "Ambuja Plus", "Mojo Media LLP", "Roof Special", "Guptaji", "What's up on your Chhat"], "tags": ["Guptaji", "BE Saal Baad", "Roof Special", "BE Cafe", "Solologues", "Interviews", "Olympics", "Strategygram", "Martequity", "What's up on your Chhat", "Ambuja Plus", "Ambuja Cement", "Experience Commerce", "Mojo Media LLP"], "article_images": "https://etimg.etb2bimg.com/thumb/msid-59351568,imgsize-30753,width-1200,height=765,overlay-etbrandequity/advertising/watch-guptaji-ki-kahaani-in-ambuja-cements-new-ad-campaign.jpg", "all_images": ["https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/arrow-right.svg", "https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/linkedin-icon.png", "https://brandequity.economictimes.indiatimes.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/whatsapp-share.svg", "https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/logos/brandequity-logo-mobile-header.svg?mod=2839", "https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/comment-icon.svg?mod=2839", "https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/bar-codes/brandequity_barcode.png?mod=2839", "https://etimg.etb2bimg.com/thumb/msid-59351568,imgsize-30753,width-1200,height=765,overlay-etbrandequity/advertising/watch-guptaji-ki-kahaani-in-ambuja-cements-new-ad-campaign.jpg", "https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/et-icon.svg", "https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/logos/brandequity-logo-header.svg?mod=2839", "https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/icon-newsletter.svg", "https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/bookmarked-icon.svg", "https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/icon-search.svg", "https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/bookmark-icon-grey.svg?mod=2", "https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/twitter-icon.png", "https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/icon-g-play.png", "https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/app-store-icon.png", "https://brandequity.economictimes.indiatimes.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/facebook-share.svg", "https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/icon-home.svg", "https://brandequity.economictimes.indiatimes.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/copy-icon.svg", "https://brandequity.economictimes.indiatimes.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/telegram-share.svg", "https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/newsletter-icon.webp", "https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/gplay-icon.png", "https://brandequity.economictimes.indiatimes.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/linkedin-share.svg", "https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/icon-reader.svg", "https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/insta-icon.png", "https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/icon-app-store.png", "https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/icon-no-comments.svg", "https://img.etb2bimg.com/files/cp/upload-1716880754-etbrandequity-default.webp", "https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/facebook-icon.png", "https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/logos/brandequity-logo-footer.svg?mod=2839", "https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/icon-share-arrow.png", "https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/youtube-icon.png", "https://brandequity.economictimes.indiatimes.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/twitter-share.svg"], "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "google-site-verification": "ZgFICIedNvVZl5pV9EfAUeenwta9vBY0Za_GgmV4zuw", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "author": "www.ETBrandEquity.com", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Watch 'Guptaji ki kahaani' in Ambuja Cement's new ad campaign -

PCIL’s strategic location and sufficient limestone reserves provide an opportunity to increase cement capacity through debottlenecking and additional investment. Importantly, the bulk cement terminals (BCTs) will prove to be a gamechanger by giving access to the eastern and southern parts of peninsular India, apart from an entry to Sri Lanka, through the sea route. Our aim is to make PCIL highly competitive on cost and productivity and improve its operating performance.”\n\nPCIL has 14 MTPA cement capacity, of which 10 MTPA is operational, and the remaining is under construction at Krishnapatnam (2 MTPA) and Jodhpur (2 MTPA) and will be completed within 6 to 12 months.

The limited capacity of the pond led to water scarcity issues, impacting daily life, agriculture, and livestock. The community, recognizing the importance of the pond, sought its deepening to ensure a more reliable and sustainable water supply.\n\nAmbuja Cements collaborated closely with local authorities to implement a comprehensive water conservation initiative. At the heart of this effort was the strategic deepening of the local pond—a lifeline for Magarway village.\n\nThe company's efforts have substantially enhanced water availability for nearly 500 residents, positively impacting their daily lives by providing sustainable access to water. Now, the pond's capacity has been expanded to an impressive 3,606 cubic meters, with a profound impact on groundwater levels, resulting in a water supply for 6 to 8 months annually.\n\nAmbuja Cements' initiative underscores a commitment to long-term, sustainable resource management going beyond immediate relief. This aligns seamlessly with the company's mission to uplift rural communities and drive positive change.

One can safely call that particular spot, an iconic one, considering the kind of conversations it still creates even today. The film which was designed and conceptualized by Publicis India, associated with brand four long years, and then mutually decided to part ways.Ambuja Cement, recently, launched a new video with the help of Triton Communications for its series of films based on true events that take place on the ‘chhat’ (roof). This is a part of the brand’s #ChhatPeMilteHain campaign, for its premium cement offering ‘Ambuja Plus Roof Special’.The film which is scripted by Gulzar celebrates chhat (roof/terrace) and the significant role it plays even today in India, and was shot in Lucknow, Udaipur and Varanasi.In the spot, the ‘chhat’ is portrayed to be a place of discovery, of childhood, escape, romance, derring-do, celebrations, secret hide-aways and open skies; it is seen like the perfect place without walls.Ambuja Cement has decided to run this campaign purely on its digital platforms. When we asked Vivek Deshpande , head of brand and marketing strategy, Ambuja Cements, the strategy behind this move, he said, “It is in line with our overall brand strategy. We are using social media for deeper engagement with the consumer. We would like that the viewer’s share and relive their moments with the brand. Social media seems to be working well for us. We will continue to invest a good part of our marketing budget in it.\"", "source_link": "https://brandequity.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/advertising/watch-ambuja-cements-new-digital-film-is-scripted-by-gulzar/62689328", "keywords": ["great khali", "Ambuja Cement’", "Vivek Deshpande", "Triton Communications", "GUlzar", "Khali Ad"], "tags": ["BE Saal Baad", "great khali", "Khali Ad", "Gulzar", "BE Cafe", "Solologues", "Interviews", "Olympics", "Strategygram", "Martequity", "Ambuja Cement’", "GUlzar", "Triton Communications", "Vivek Deshpande"], "article_images": "https://etimg.etb2bimg.com/thumb/msid-62689328,imgsize-22754,width-1200,height=765,overlay-etbrandequity/advertising/watch-ambuja-cements-new-digital-film-is-scripted-by-gulzar.jpg", "all_images": ["https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/arrow-right.svg", "https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/linkedin-icon.png", "https://brandequity.economictimes.indiatimes.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/whatsapp-share.svg", "https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/logos/brandequity-logo-mobile-header.svg?mod=2839", "https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/comment-icon.svg?mod=2839", "https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/bar-codes/brandequity_barcode.png?mod=2839", "https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/et-icon.svg", "https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/logos/brandequity-logo-header.svg?mod=2839", "https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/icon-newsletter.svg", "https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/bookmarked-icon.svg", "https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/icon-search.svg", "https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/bookmark-icon-grey.svg?mod=2", "https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/twitter-icon.png", "https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/icon-g-play.png", "https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/app-store-icon.png", "https://brandequity.economictimes.indiatimes.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/facebook-share.svg", "https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/icon-home.svg", "https://brandequity.economictimes.indiatimes.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/copy-icon.svg", "https://brandequity.economictimes.indiatimes.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/telegram-share.svg", "https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/newsletter-icon.webp", "https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/gplay-icon.png", "https://brandequity.economictimes.indiatimes.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/linkedin-share.svg", "https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/icon-reader.svg", "https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/insta-icon.png", "https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/icon-app-store.png", "https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/icon-no-comments.svg", "https://img.etb2bimg.com/files/cp/upload-1716880754-etbrandequity-default.webp", "https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/facebook-icon.png", "https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/logos/brandequity-logo-footer.svg?mod=2839", "https://brandequity.economictimes.indiatimes.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/et-default-user.svg", "https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/icon-share-arrow.png", "https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/youtube-icon.png", "https://brandequity.economictimes.indiatimes.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/twitter-share.svg", "https://etimg.etb2bimg.com/thumb/msid-62689328,imgsize-22754,width-1200,height=765,overlay-etbrandequity/advertising/watch-ambuja-cements-new-digital-film-is-scripted-by-gulzar.jpg"], "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "google-site-verification": "ZgFICIedNvVZl5pV9EfAUeenwta9vBY0Za_GgmV4zuw", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "author": "www.ETBrandEquity.com", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Watch: Ambuja Cement's new digital film is scripted by Gulzar -

In a monumental stride towards a greener future, the Company has committed a significant investment of Rs. 6,000 crores in renewable power projects, targeting a capacity of 1,000 MW.\n\nThis transformative investment encompasses a diverse portfolio of solar and wind power projects strategically positioned across Gujarat and Rajasthan. The lineup includes a 600 MW Solar Power project and 150 MW Wind Power project in Gujarat and a 250 MW Solar Power project in Rajasthan. This will be achieved by FY 2026 (200 MW by March’24) in addition to the existing 84 MW of Solar & Wind Power.\n\nThe investment not only demonstrates our commitment to environmental sustainability but also promises compelling economic advantages to Ambuja’s planned larger capacity of 140 MPTA. With lower cost of generation from green power, the power cost will come down from Rs.6.46 per kWh to Rs.5.16 per kWh. A reduction of Rs. 1.30 per kWh (20%), which translates into Rs. 90 PMT of cement for targeted capacity of 140 MTPA by FY 2028, accelerating the Company’s ESG targets. Additionally, green power will assist in enabling an increased supply of green cement, making it possible for the user industry (infrastructure and housing) to go green.\n\nAmbuja Cements is also enhancing its Waste Heat Recovery Systems (WHRS) capacity from the current 103 MW to 397 MW over the period of 5 years (134 MW by March’24), which will further reduce the power cost.\n\nThese initiatives are pivotal part of a broader vision which will help Ambuja achieve the leading share of Green Power amongst its peers, reaching 60% for the planned capacity of 140 MTPA from the current 19%.\n\nAjay Kapur, CEO, Cement Business, said, \"This strategic investment reaffirms our steadfast commitment to sustainable practices. We are not just aiming for a substantial increase in green power capacity but setting the stage for a transformative shift in the cement industry. They align not only with our growth trajectory but also with the national objective of de-carbonization and greener future and this helps us become competitive and sustainable. The adjacencies within the Group will further catalyze benefit realization. With all requisite approvals in place, we are on an accelerated path to not just meet but exceed our committed ESG targets well before our initial timelines.\"\n\nWith this monumental leap, Ambuja has firmly established itself as a trailblazer in the cement industry, setting the stage for a more sustainable future.", "source_link": "https://www.rprealtyplus.com/allied/ambuja-cements-to-power-60-of-its-production-with-green-power-113325.html", "keywords": ["Ambuja Cements Limited", "greener future", "Waste Heat Recovery Systems", "transformative shift", "sustainable future"], "tags": [], "article_images": "https://storage.googleapis.com/realtyplusmag-news-photo/news-photo/113325.Ambuja-Cements-To-Power-60%-Of-Its-Production-With-Green-Power.jpg", "all_images": ["https://storage.googleapis.com/realtyplusmag-news-photo/news-photo/118576.South-Africa’s-new-multi-billion-smart-city.jpg", "https://storage.googleapis.com/realtyplusmag-news-photo/news-photo/113325.Ambuja-Cements-To-Power-60%-Of-Its-Production-With-Green-Power.jpg", "https://storage.googleapis.com/realtyplusmag-news-photo/news-photo/118577.trump-wh-ap-rc-200703_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "https://storage.googleapis.com/realtyplusmag-news-photo/news-photo/album/default-staff.png", "https://storage.googleapis.com/realtyplusmag-news-photo/news-photo/epaper/01252025213500-Cover-image---dimension---592-X-774-(1).png", "https://storage.googleapis.com/e4m-news-photo/news-photo/static-images/twitter-logo-large-dark.png", "https://storage.googleapis.com/realtyplusmag-news-photo/news-photo/118578.Naresh-Tyagi,-Chairman-of-the-ICC-National-Expert-Committee-on-Sustainability-and-Chief-Sustainability-Officer,-Aditya-Birla-Fashion-and-Retail-Limited-(1).jpg", "https://www.rprealtyplus.com/img/subscribe-mag.png", "https://storage.googleapis.com/realtyplusmag-news-photo/news-photo/118778.Shree-Cement.png", "https://storage.googleapis.com/realtyplusmag-news-photo/news-photo/118780.Surface-Décor-Dorby.png", "https://storage.googleapis.com/realtyplusmag-news-photo/news-photo/epaper/01072025182910-Cover-image---dimension---592-X-774.png", "https://storage.googleapis.com/realtyplusmag-news-photo/news-photo/118779.SRM.png", "https://storage.googleapis.com/realtyplusmag-news-photo/news-photo/newsletter/11182024180946-Realty-Plus---780x90-Pixels.jpg", "https://www.rprealtyplus.com/images/logo.png"], "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "csrf-token": "pHSToeUM0MF4XXoKUR2fxjDCuUskeQxao0SGvE6z", "title": "Ambuja Cements To Power 60% Of Its Production With Green Power", "description": "Ambuja Cements To Power 60% Of Its Production With Green Power", "keywords": "Ambuja Cements Limited, greener future, Waste Heat Recovery Systems, transformative shift, sustainable future", "news_keywords": "Ambuja Cements Limited, greener future, Waste Heat Recovery Systems, transformative shift, sustainable future", "image_src": "https://storage.googleapis.com/realtyplusmag-news-photo/news-photo/113325.Ambuja-Cements-To-Power-60%-Of-Its-Production-With-Green-Power.jpg", "og": {"title": "Ambuja Cements To Power 60% Of Its Production With Green Power", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.rprealtyplus.com/allied/ambuja-cements-to-power-60-of-its-production-with-green-power-113325.html", "site_name": "Realty Plus Magazine", "image": {"identifier": "https://storage.googleapis.com/realtyplusmag-news-photo/news-photo/113325.Ambuja-Cements-To-Power-60%-Of-Its-Production-With-Green-Power.jpg", "width": 870, "height": 470}, "description": "Ambuja Cements To Power 60% Of Its Production With Green Power"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "https://twitter.com/RPRealtyPlus", "creator": "@RPRealtyPlus", "title": "Ambuja Cements To Power 60% Of Its Production With Green Power", "image": {"src": "https://storage.googleapis.com/realtyplusmag-news-photo/news-photo/113325.Ambuja-Cements-To-Power-60%-Of-Its-Production-With-Green-Power.jpg"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/rprealtyplus/"}, "fb": {"app_id": 762410207182368}}, "ambuja_kawach_count": 0, "ambuja_cool_walls_count": 0, "ambuja_compocem_count": 0, "ultratech_weather_pro_flex_count": 0, "shree_aac_blocks_count": 0, "ambuja_plus_count": 0, "ultratech_flex_count": 0, "shree_adhesives_count": 0},

We deep dive into the brand’s tale of epitomizing quirk and humor with strength.\n\nTwo estranged brothers- SR Thakur and KR Thakur- separated by a giant wall, desperately wish to get back together leaving all the grudges behind. They try every tactic possible to break the wall. From using hammers and other tools to bombing it down - the wall stands still strong. It should be noticed that the setup and melodrama portrayed in the one minute film is no less than a Bollywood movie. But this was a TV commercial shot back in 2001-02 as a part of the Ambuja Cement advertising journey.\n\n“Bhaiyaaaa, ye deewar toot ti kyu nahi”, cries the other brother (played by veteran actor Boman Irani) and prompt comes the voiceover- “Tootegi kaise, Ambuja Cement se jo bani hai”.\n\nHere we go remembering the intense drama upholstered with the\n\nbrand purpose into the film which very conveniently delivered the message home\n\nthat Ambuja Cement stands for ‘giant compressive strength’.\n\nThe\n\nAmbuja Journey\n\nBuilding an entire empire out of cement manufacturing and production was a tough call. Ambuja Cement set up shop in 1983 and was a brainchild of two traders namely Narotam Sekhsaria and Suresh Neotia, who had very little knowledge of cement or manufacturing. Anticipating that cement would be a critical resource for a developing economy like India, they invested in a state-of-the-art cement plant in Gujarat and went on to build a trusted cement brand that has become synonymous with quality and strength. This premier status got a boost in 2005 – Ambuja Cements (as the company was known then) and another premier Indian cement company, ACC Limited, became a part of the reputed Holcim Group of Switzerland.\n\nWith a legacy of over 35 years, Ambuja Cement has taken pride in its brand philosophy of ‘I Can’ with an aim to push boundaries and achieve results that have enabled the company to become one of India’s foremost cement companies for decades now.\n\nAmbuja Cement advertising journey\n\nCement has always been touted as one of those low involvement categories and to market, a product like it requires an ‘hatke’ promotion and advertising strategy. Ambuja Cement followed the mantra of indulging into not-so-serious advertising and grasp on the humor quotient to attract consumers’ attention towards the brand.\n\nThe brand time and again stayed away from stereotypical ‘adulterated’ or ‘milavat wala cement’ ads or even portraying gigantic buildings and dam walls to show the strength or quality of cement. The company set a vision of indomitable spirit for itself and went onto mix rationale advertising with a dash of humor. Owing to this, Ambuja Cement came up with geniuses like the evergreen ‘Bhai Bhai TVC’and ‘Muskaan’ tv ads to drive home the point of that ‘strength of the cement lies in the strength if emotion’.\n\nGrey Worldwide, the agency on record then, joined hands with Ambuja Cement and while branding the cement commodity, concentrated on its core brand promise of “Strength\". The insight that triggered most of the campaign ideas was that strength is a very highly relevant attribute as far as the customer is concerned and if given an emotional touch can strike the right chord.\n\nThe ‘Muskaan’ TVC came right after the ‘Dadi’ commercial which could not manage to spread much chatter as the brand tried to induce an excess of human touch and focussed on the strong relationships that are built amidst strong houses.\n\nWith ‘Muskaan’, Ambuja Cement was back talking about ‘unbreakable walls’ and reiterate the idea of “Ambuja Cement. Yeh Deewaar Nahin Tootegi”. The kid in the TVC is seen recalling the most memorable ‘Bhai Bhai’ scenario where the wall refused to break down even after several attempts. The commercial had a stark reference of the prior communication albeit a different setup.\n\nThe advertising portfolio of Ambuja Cement boasts of different flavors – on the menu being comedy, fun, drama induced with lots of personification. The brand sought to relate to its consumers on different levels by identifying genres they find solace in. Hence with a mix of comedy and drama in its advertising for instance the ‘Vijay, it became successful in finding a loyal consumer base who not only was loyal to the brand but raved about its advertising.\n\nAn animated video showcasing the giant as the mascot of the brand and the rising towers was created to convey the ‘giants of giant’ proposition of Ambuja Cement.\n\nNurturing and building relationships\n\nWhether it be a tribute to one of the strongest personalities in our life- Our Fathers- or our grandmothers with ‘Dadi TVC’, Ambuja Cement has always highlighted the building up of strong relationships owing to the strong walls of our houses ‘buniyad’ and why it plays a pivotal role in keeping a family closer.\n\nStanding strong against Caste parity and disharmony\n\nUnlike most of its competitors in the market, Ambuja Cement has gone much beyond being just an essential commodity brand to being a messenger for good and positivity. The brand has been vocal about societal issues like caste, socio-economic, and religious disparity and firmly believed in equality for all.\n\nThe company’s beliefs were reflected in its communication with campaigns like ‘Arjun Deewar’ Tvc and ‘Jaat Paat’, ‘Bhed Bhav’ films putting out a strong message to break the walls of disharmony and inequality.\n\nLater in 2014 when Ambuja Cement entrusted its creative duties to Publicis India the result was an ad that took the social media world by storm. A video cum mockumentary conceptualized by the agency featured wrestling champion ‘The Great Khali’ was titled ‘giant strength for the giant’ with a humourous and lighthearted approach. The campaign also featured in Social Samosa's Eternal Campaigns of the Decade.\n\nIt highlighted the story of Khali’s life where he himself goes onto narrate how the strength which gave him recognition was turning to be his biggest problem. The ad also hilariously reinvented cement as a product an average person should invest in. The impact was so much that within a week of its appearance on YouTube, it was watched, liked, and shared 15 lakh plus times and also went onto win several awards.\n\nApart from being exceptional at narrating human stories through its television commercials and web films, Ambuja Cement is popularly known for its tongue-in-cheek print advertising. In 2015 a set of newspaper advertisements were conceived by Publicis for the brand showing gigantic animals like Hippo, Elephant, and Rhino resembling the power of the single Ambuja Cement product also inhibiting in them a house map.\n\nYet again, in 2018, what caught people’s attention was when Ambuja Cements took to newspapers to reiterate its pledge to “a carbon footprint-conscious growth”. The company was ranked second globally by the Carbon Disclosure Project in the world in business readiness for a low carbon economy transition. The full-page print ads displayed its Q1 2018 financial results.\n\nThe copy on the ad read: Our Cement’s Final Output is Clear Blue; the results sit tabulated at the bottom of the page.\n\nThe ads were a brainchild of Alok Nanda and Company. The company is in the habit of creating ads for its quarterly financial results always harking back to the brand purpose of Ambuja Cements - I Can.\n\nNarrator\n\nof the Rooftop stories\n\nPartnering with Triton Communications in 2018, Ambuja Cements switched & was back at harping onto emotions through its communication this time rolling out a web film narrating the stories of ‘rooftops’ titled ‘Chhatein’.\n\nThe first film was launched on the occasion of Independence Dat which told the story from the eyes of two friends - Sankar and Salim - divided by religion but united by unbreakable bonds and rooftop stories.\n\nAfter ‘Gupta Ji Ki Kahaani’ and unveiling the ‘chhat’ tales of Shankar and Salim, the third film was penned down by maestro Gulzar, the poem and the picturization depicted slice of life moments and various stories that took birth on the roofs of desi houses over a cup of chai while catching up with the sunset or a game of chess.\n\nAll the films were a part of the brand’s larger campaign ‘Chhat Pe Milte Hain' for its premium 'Ambuja Plus Roof Special' offering\n\nThe brand’s current communication revolves around stories of strength and positivity amid the pandemic induced lockdown and the various CSR initiatives Ambuja Cement has stepped up for.\n\nMarking the digital presence\n\nWhile on Instagram the brand is walking the talk with topical posts and moment marketing around COVID 19 safety precautions and consumer engagement activities, the brand’s Facebook page is a testimony to the company’s various efforts to tackle the current crisis and help those in need.\n\nMeanwhile, on Youtube, Ambuja Cement is actively rolling out the video featuring the company leaders and their thoughts to cope up with the crisis, also simultaneously displaying the CSR efforts undertaken by it.\n\n\n\n\n\nStriking a balance between humor and emotions, Ambuja Cement’s primary objectives of the advertisement is creating awareness, build salience, and having a top of mind recall. The Ambuja Cement Advertising Journey reinforces the brand purpose and its positioning as the “Strongest cement” or symbol of compressive strength.", "source_link": "https://www.socialsamosa.com/2020/06/brand-saga-ambuja-cement-advertising-journey/", "keywords": ["ambuja cement", "ambuja cement ads", "ambuja cement advertising", "Ambuja Cement advertising journey", "ambuja cement archives", "ambuja cement brand journey", "ambuja cement brand saga", "ambuja cement old ads"], "tags": ["ambuja cement brand journey", "ambuja cement brand saga", "ambuja cement old ads", "ambuja cement archives", "ambuja cement advertising", "ambuja cement", "ambuja cement ads", "Ambuja Cement advertising journey"], "article_images": "https://img-cdn.thepublive.com/fit-in/1200x675/socialsamosa/media/post_banners/qZo0gmXuUCRnaWs0k5hw.jpg", "all_images": ["https://img-cdn.thepublive.com/filters:format(webp)/socialsamosa/media/post_attachments/CdLSyPt5Pc7aCNX9PlWw.png", "https://img-cdn.thepublive.com/fit-in/0x0/filters:format(webp)/socialsamosa/media/media_files/2024/10/21/leaderboard-new-alt.png", "https://img-cdn.thepublive.com/fit-in/0x0/filters:format(webp)/socialsamosa/media/media_files/2024/12/05/WRrccyEF4Vjy4P88siNI.png", "https://img-cdn.thepublive.com/fit-in/0x0/filters:format(webp)/socialsamosa/media/media_files/2024/10/21/post-alt.png", "https://img-cdn.thepublive.com/filters:format(webp)/socialsamosa/media/post_attachments/8SyVtXVtQsk2wyKaUZ9z.jpg", "https://img-cdn.thepublive.com/fit-in/1280x960/filters:format(webp)/socialsamosa/media/post_banners/qZo0gmXuUCRnaWs0k5hw.jpg", "https://www.socialsamosa.com/static/images/svg%20icons/cross_svg.svg", "https://img-cdn.thepublive.com/filters:format(webp)/socialsamosa/media/post_attachments/GEJiKVbB6Rgz2ytmOb0E.jpg", "https://img-cdn.thepublive.com/fit-in/1200x675/socialsamosa/media/post_banners/qZo0gmXuUCRnaWs0k5hw.jpg", "https://img-cdn.thepublive.com/filters:format(webp)/socialsamosa/media/post_attachments/lfdNeCKxvKIUtAfs00Dx.jpg", "https://img-cdn.thepublive.com/filters:format(webp)/socialsamosa/media/post_attachments/cA6oTqZE69YbYNor3Hyi.jpg", "https://www.socialsamosa.com/static/images/google_news.png", "https://img-cdn.thepublive.com/fit-in/0x0/filters:format(webp)/socialsamosa/media/media_files/2025/01/06/AT0WJDKXpqxYOgZsEp8V.jpg", "https://img-cdn.thepublive.com/fit-in/580x326/filters:format(webp)/socialsamosa/media/agency_attachments/PrjL49L3c0mVA7YcMDHB.png", "https://www.socialsamosa.com/static/images/svg%20icons/user-avatar.svg"], "article_metadata": {"robots": "max-image-preview:large", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "google-site-verification": "vtfC4BzNG6uvNonTEYGQ8tw6Pt7B6pbipWMrCMl87r0", "og": {"title": "Brand Saga: Ambuja Cement, an epic tale of humor, strength & emotions", "type": "Article", "url": "https://www.socialsamosa.com/2020/06/brand-saga-ambuja-cement-advertising-journey/", "site_name": "SocialSamosa", "locale": "en_IN", "image": {"identifier": "https://img-cdn.thepublive.com/fit-in/1200x675/socialsamosa/media/post_banners/qZo0gmXuUCRnaWs0k5hw.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 1200, "height": 675}}, "keywords": "ambuja cement, ambuja cement ads, ambuja cement advertising, Ambuja Cement advertising journey, ambuja cement archives, ambuja cement brand journey, ambuja cement brand saga, ambuja cement old ads", "news_keywords": "ambuja cement, ambuja cement ads, ambuja cement advertising, Ambuja Cement advertising journey, ambuja cement archives, ambuja cement brand journey, ambuja cement brand saga, ambuja cement old ads", "author": "Sneha Yadav", "twitter": {"title": "Brand Saga: Ambuja Cement, an epic tale of humor, strength & emotions", "site": "SocialSamosa", "url": "https://www.socialsamosa.com/2020/06/brand-saga-ambuja-cement-advertising-journey/", "image": {"identifier": "https://img-cdn.thepublive.com/fit-in/1200x675/socialsamosa/media/post_banners/qZo0gmXuUCRnaWs0k5hw.jpg", "width": 1200, "height": 675, "type": "image/jpeg"}, "card": "summary_large_image"}}, "ambuja_kawach_count": 0, "ambuja_cool_walls_count": 0, "ambuja_compocem_count": 0, "ultratech_weather_pro_flex_count": 0, "shree_aac_blocks_count": 0, "ambuja_plus_count": 1, "ultratech_flex_count": 0, "shree_adhesives_count": 0},

Triton Communications creates a 4-minute-long video that captures the soul of India's rooftops.

Publicis' hilarious award-winning video in which Khali throws his weight around - quite literally - for the cement brand, tickled many a funny bone. They parted ways last year.\n\nCut to the present: Triton Communications has created a long-form video for the brand titled 'Chhatein' (Hindi for rooftops) that captures the slice-of-life moments that typically take place on the roofs of desi, semi-urban homes - bonding over chess, stealing moments to admire the neighbourhood heart-throb and flying kites to name a few.\n\n'Chhatein': Ambuja Cement's latest ad film\n\nReplete with local nuances that bring out the importance of the 'chhat' in the home and heart of a small town Indian, the video is a lyrical montage to India's rooftop life as poet Gulzar would imagine it - or glean from real life, actually.\n\nAmbuja Cement's digital ad featuring 'The Great Khali'\n\nGulzar has also done the voice-over for this film. The branding element is visible only towards the very end.\n\nThis video is the third in the brand's 'Chhat Pe Milte Hain' campaign for its premium 'Ambuja Plus Roof Special' offering. A few months ago, Triton created films titled 'Gupta Ji Ki Kahaani' and then 'Salim Aur Shankar Ki Kahaani' for the brand, albeit as projects. These are also chhat-themed stories set in semi-urban India. The current film is the first ad the agency has created as Ambuja's on-record creative partner.\n\n'Gupta Ji Ki Kahaani': The first film of #ChhatPeMilteHain campaign\n\nIn conversation with afaqs! about changing not just agencies but the creative track - from snappy humour to soulful storytelling - Vivek Deshpande, head of brand and marketing strategy, Ambuja Cement, says, \"Our core customer is one who builds his own house in a small town. He has always featured in our ads. This video and the previous two films in the series are aimed at building deeper engagement with the consumer by rekindling his memories of 'chhat.'\" Deshpande has spent 30 years at Ambuja.\n\n'Salim Aur Shankar Ki Kahaani': The second ad film of #ChhatPeMilteHain campaign\n\nHis agency partner, Ullas Chopra, national creative director, Triton Communications, says, \"Ambuja is a brand that's always been about 'giant strength'. Their most popular and loved spot is still the 'Bhai-Bhai' commercial (with Boman Irani, created by Grey and directed by Abhinay Deo in 2002), which the client continues to run! Our task is to keep that certain 'Ambujaness' of the brand alive as we reinterpret the proposition of 'giant strength' in different ways for Ambuja's speciality brands like 'Roof Special' and 'Cool Walls'. We intend to do this by exploring both emotion and humour. The challenge is to retain strength, draw attention to the specialist product and not confuse things with the mother brand.\"\n\nVivek Deshpande\n\nUllas Chopra\n\nThe film was shot in Udaipur, Lucknow and Varanasi. Speaking about the challenges of shooting the film, Triton's Chopra says, \"It was a long and strenuous 12-day schedule - six days of shooting and the rest for auditions, location checks and travel. The biggest challenge for us while doing this film was local casting. Secondly, we climbed 400-odd rooftops for location hunting. But the film feels more real because of that...\"\n\nAmbuja's Deshpande adds, \"The 'chhat' idea came out of two things: the simple insight that almost everyone in our target group has some attachment with this part of the house and the fact that we have special cement for a roof/slab.\"\n\nTraditionally a TVC-led brand, Ambuja has begun to explore the online media space of late. Several memes and viewer-generated content, built around Ambuja's strength, are floating about online. But the brand team is keen on creating deeper engagement and not just revelling in the pleasure of giving people a momentary chuckle through this platform. Deshpande's team has been using social networking platforms such as YouTube and Facebook to gauge the response of the audience in real-time and has been noting their comments and reactions to his ads.\n\n\"Being a video-driven campaign, YouTube and Facebook were an intuitive fit. With YouTube, it was more about gaining quality reach. However, what we found was that these films were being shared heavily over WhatsApp as well, which was a pleasant outcome for us indeed,\" informs Deshpande.\n\nFurther, the brand plans to explore Instagram and Twitter and will continue to invest in social media.\n\nAd Review\n\nWe asked the experts if a change of creative partners works, in terms of amplifying the brand proposition and if the film succeeded in making an impact in the consumers' mind.\n\nSameer Aasht, founder director, Alma Mater Biz Solutions and ex-strategy head, Taproot India, feels cement is a challenging category to create communication for and that both Publicis' 'Khali' ad, as well as Triton's 'Chhat' ad, are genuine efforts to make a cement brand exciting and relevant. \"Both ads are impressive in their own ways as they are entertaining stories to watch and are well produced. The business impact, by way of brand growth, is likely to be positive, but not exponential,\" he says.\n\nSameer Aasht\n\nHarish Bijoor\n\nAasht goes on to point out that unlike paints where colour, texture, finish quality, and overall service quality ensure the consumer journey has more 'proof points' for a brand to exploit in its advertising, these are lacking in categories like cement and steel.\n\n\"This makes the promise of strength difficult to prove...\" he says, \"...and most brands resort to giving a metaphor or emotional touch to their promise by creating life demonstrations, exaggerations, stories, poetry, music, scale, etc. Both kinds of ads make for good brand entertainment, but despite the best intentions and very visible efforts, products from these segments often run the risk of missing exponential brand growth or business impact.\"\n\nOn the other hand, Harish Bijoor, a brand-expert and founder, Harish Bijoor Consults Inc., feels this is story-telling for the digital era. According to him, the execution is long and laborious. He says, \"Even in sheer story-telling terms, I would expect a version that is crisper and more to the point. This will not sell a single bag of cement, but instead, does a good generic job of building the story of the rooftop - the great Indian rooftop.\"\n\nCredits\n\nBrand: Ambuja Plus Roof

Bubble Barrier is a smart and non-invasive technology that is used to remove plastic from the water bodies, reducing the problem of marine plastic pollution in our country.\n\nThe Company has received a NOC from BBMB to install this innovative technology which will remove approximately 1500 tonnes per year of waste from the lake.\n\nThe BBMB Lake has been floating with light organic material which has been accumulated over the years resulting of choking at the discharge point of the lake. The Company’s Geocycle Bubble Barrier technology will not only collect plastic but also lighter materials like floating debris, organic wastes, etc. from the lake, thus, reducing the chances of choking.\n\nThis technology has been installed in Himachal Pradesh with ACC Gagal Plant, which will serve as the co-processing center for the plastic recovered from the lake. The aim of this project is to co-process only non-recyclable portion of the material collected, thus, moving it to the existing waste disposal site of Sunder Nagar. The recyclable plastics will be sent to recycling facilities, while the non-recyclable plastics will be taken to Geocycle’s facility for pre-processing followed by co-processing in ACC cement kilns at Gagal plant.\n\nNeeraj Akhoury, CEO India Holcim and Managing Director & CEO of Ambuja Cements Ltd said, “We are committed to building a sustainable future by adopting clean and green technologies. Our efforts and expertise in co-processing has created a unique solution to sustainable disposal of the marine plastic waste that creates pollution. This initiative will also contribute towards promoting circular economy. Taking this mission ahead, we will continue our efforts to implement this innovative technology across the country.”\n\nThe collection of plastics from leaking into the rivers will help the local community around the plant. Furthermore, the Company has commissioned its pilot project in Agra which has already removed 500 tonnes of plastic waste from the Yamuna River. Recently, the Company has also received a NOC from Varanasi Municipal Corporation to install another bubble barrier technology.", "source_link": "https://www.rprealtyplus.com/allied/ambuja-cements-acc-commission-to-remove-plastic-in-himachal-pradesh-105252.html", "keywords": ["Ambuja Cements", "ACC", "Commission", "Remove Plastic", "Himachal Pradesh", "Neeraj Akhoury", "CEO India Holcim and Managing Director & CEO of Ambuja Cements Ltd", "Yamuna River", "Geocycle Bubble Barrier technology", "BBMB Lake"], "tags": [], "article_images": "https://storage.googleapis.com/realtyplusmag-news-photo/news-photo/105252.BBMB-Lake.jpg", "all_images": ["https://storage.googleapis.com/realtyplusmag-news-photo/news-photo/118576.South-Africa’s-new-multi-billion-smart-city.jpg", "https://storage.googleapis.com/realtyplusmag-news-photo/news-photo/118577.trump-wh-ap-rc-200703_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "https://storage.googleapis.com/realtyplusmag-news-photo/news-photo/105252.BBMB-Lake.jpg", "https://storage.googleapis.com/realtyplusmag-news-photo/news-photo/album/default-staff.png", "https://storage.googleapis.com/realtyplusmag-news-photo/news-photo/epaper/01252025213500-Cover-image---dimension---592-X-774-(1).png", "https://storage.googleapis.com/e4m-news-photo/news-photo/static-images/twitter-logo-large-dark.png", "https://storage.googleapis.com/realtyplusmag-news-photo/news-photo/118578.Naresh-Tyagi,-Chairman-of-the-ICC-National-Expert-Committee-on-Sustainability-and-Chief-Sustainability-Officer,-Aditya-Birla-Fashion-and-Retail-Limited-(1).jpg", "https://www.rprealtyplus.com/img/subscribe-mag.png", "https://storage.googleapis.com/realtyplusmag-news-photo/news-photo/118778.Shree-Cement.png", "https://storage.googleapis.com/realtyplusmag-news-photo/news-photo/118780.Surface-Décor-Dorby.png", "https://storage.googleapis.com/realtyplusmag-news-photo/news-photo/epaper/01072025182910-Cover-image---dimension---592-X-774.png", "https://storage.googleapis.com/realtyplusmag-news-photo/news-photo/118779.SRM.png", "https://storage.googleapis.com/realtyplusmag-news-photo/news-photo/newsletter/11182024180946-Realty-Plus---780x90-Pixels.jpg", "https://www.rprealtyplus.com/images/logo.png"], "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "csrf-token": "DBprkB4amCqbWF8zIl5tsyEvo7fx1beChuQ5ESzs", "title": "Ambuja Cements & ACC Commission to Remove Plastic in Himachal Pradesh", "description": "Ambuja Cements & ACC Commission to Remove Plastic in Himachal Pradesh", "keywords": "Ambuja Cements, ACC, Commission , Remove Plastic,Himachal Pradesh, Neeraj Akhoury, CEO India Holcim and Managing Director & CEO of Ambuja Cements Ltd, Yamuna River, Geocycle Bubble Barrier technology, BBMB Lake", "news_keywords": "Ambuja Cements, ACC, Commission , Remove Plastic,Himachal Pradesh, Neeraj Akhoury, CEO India Holcim and Managing Director & CEO of Ambuja Cements Ltd, Yamuna River, Geocycle Bubble Barrier technology, BBMB Lake", "image_src": "https://storage.googleapis.com/realtyplusmag-news-photo/news-photo/105252.BBMB-Lake.jpg", "og": {"title": "Ambuja Cements & ACC Commission to Remove Plastic in Himachal Pradesh", "type": "article", "url": "https://rprealtyplus.com/allied/ambuja-cements-acc-commission-to-remove-plastic-in-himachal-pradesh-105252.html", "site_name": "Realty Plus Magazine", "image": {"identifier": "https://storage.googleapis.com/realtyplusmag-news-photo/news-photo/105252.BBMB-Lake.jpg", "width": 870, "height": 470}, "description": "Ambuja Cements & ACC Commission to Remove Plastic in Himachal Pradesh"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "https://twitter.com/RPRealtyPlus", "creator": "@RPRealtyPlus", "title": "Ambuja Cements & ACC Commission to Remove Plastic in Himachal Pradesh", "image": {"src": "https://storage.googleapis.com/realtyplusmag-news-photo/news-photo/105252.BBMB-Lake.jpg"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/rprealtyplus/"}, "fb": {"app_id": 762410207182368}}, "ambuja_kawach_count": 0, "ambuja_cool_walls_count": 0, "ambuja_compocem_count": 0, "ultratech_weather_pro_flex_count": 0, "shree_aac_blocks_count": 0, "ambuja_plus_count": 0, "ultratech_flex_count": 0, "shree_adhesives_count": 0},

The initiative also encourages entrepreneurship among its students and motivates them to start their own venture to improve their economic condition.\n\nSEDI is running 43 certified courses at its 35 centres in eight domains such as IT/ITES, electronics, health, construction, beauty and wellness, hospitality and tourism, automobile, capital goods, retail, telecom etc.\n\nPearl Tiwari added that, “Every year, 15 million youth enter the workforce, however industry studies say that more than 75% of them are not ‘job-ready’. In such a scenario SEDI’s achievement of providing vocational training to over 88,000 youth to make them employable, is a matter of immense satisfaction. ACF is committed to transforming the lives of people in rural areas by creating livelihoods – equipping rural men and women with the necessary skills to find a job. We look forward to continuing our efforts to bridge the skills gap that India is facing, and contributing to the Government’s Skill India Mission.”\n\nThe success of the skilling initiative has led to various corporate, government organization and NGOs providing support to expand SEDI’s footprint in various other locations – offering opportunities to more rural youth across India. ACF is also helping young people to earn, build careers and lift their families out of poverty. With gender diversity as one of its core values, ACF has also maintained a healthy 40:60 female-male ratio in each SEDI centre.

Khali", "description": "Here’s why the cement ad film is the best we’ve seen this year", "article_body": "What's the big deal about the Ambuja cement ad apart from it starring a 7-foot wrestler? Here's a list of why we think so...\n\n\n\nBecause it’s not a campaign for a cash-rich, pre-pubescent startup.\n\n\n\nThe mockumentary-style film, which depicts Dalip Singh Rana aka The Great Khali’s struggles with infrastructure is the funniest cement ad ever. However, Publicis’ Bobby Pawar wishes some of these accolades, pouring in from all quarters of the world, would come without qualifiers like “cement”. We, however, are inclined to disagree. Because part of the beauty of what is, we dare say, India’s finest (and not just the funniest) commercial in years, is the fact that it’s an ad for an over three-decade old brand of cement. The stuff a civil engineer’s dreams are made of, perhaps. But not yours and certainly not mine. That the ad belongs to a low-interest or, to get technical, a ‘boring’ category makes this campaign an even greater creative triumph. These are categories that make lesser adfolk moan and convulse in agony. How does one make Ambuja Cement one of the most famous brands in the country? Pawar wondered, “It’s not like people love cement!” Yet, within a week of its appearance on YouTube, it was watched, liked and shared 15 lakh plus times — and that’s only counting Ambuja’s official channel — by an audience that included 6 to 60 year olds, and of course the aforementioned engineers.\n\n\n\n\n\nAjay Kapur, Ambuja Cement\n\n\n\nBecause the idea came before the chicken.\n\n\n\nArtistic integrity be damned, in most cases, ideas are created, altered or hacked to suit the celebrity an advertiser paid for. In Ambuja’s case, however, the idea came before the star. They ricocheted from the genre of India-Pakistan ads to the dilemma of a man who this world wasn’t designed for. A tale of hope told in mockumentary form. When presented the idea, Ajay Kapur, MD, Ambuja Cement, tells us “something inside me said ‘this will work’. The film did not present Khali as a brand endorser. It was more about the story of a big guy having problems with his extraordinary strength.” Having said that, the ad would have been scrapped entirely if the Great Khali wasn’t available. But all it took was one Skype conversation to win over Rana, who, much to Pawar’s surprise, ‘fit in window’ and even shared photos from the family album for the ad.\n\n\n\nBecause they kept it real.\n\n\n\nDespite years of pummelling people with weaponised furniture in the WWE ring and carefully cultivating a fearsome public persona, Rana possesses a childlike naivety he rarely reveals. It was exactly this contradiction the creatives and the director, Ayappa, portrayed skillfully. The Great Khali playing a game of Blind Man’s Bluff with kids. His regular-size (in real life, too) parents having to defend him. His candid smile captured by chance at the end, after the director yelled ‘cut’ but the cameras kept rolling. According to Publicis’ Partha Sinha advertising is riddled with more clichés than it produces. But, “The celebrity here, who is not a cricketer or a Bollywood star, is part of the narrative not its carrier. There’s no weird-ass parallel between brand and celebrity. Neither did we get the celebrity to enact a story or talk mumbo-jumbo philosophy tenuously linked to the brand.” Rana’s disarming charm complements the brand’s character and reinforces its unpretentious persona. The balance of humour and empathy makes us laugh with the Great Khali and not at him.\n\n\n\n\n\n(From right to left) Publicis South Asia’s managing directors, Partha Sinha & Bobby Pawar, and Publicis India’s executive creative director, Jigar Fernandes.\n\n\n\nBecause it’s 157 kgs, 7-ft 1-in and 60-seconds of unadulterated entertainment.\n\n\n\nNowadays, most people make ad films that they might very well imagine are shoo-ins for the Palme d’Or. But every time a four-minuter appears on YouTube, advertising dies a little. So, imagine our relief when the best ad of the week, month, year or the digital era even, is just about 60 seconds long. Pawar was clear, “It’ll be as long as the idea demands or the client’s budget permits. What people tend to do is a 45 seconder for TV and a three and a half minute web-film. It ain’t that stretchable.” The Ambuja-Khali film is the product of creatives who didn’t hesitate to kill all their darlings. In fact, ECD, Jigar Fernandes was terribly keen to add one more sequence: Rana opens the door for his mausi. But mausi enters the home through a Khali-shaped hole in the wall. Because that scene was edited out, the viewer is allowed time to laugh. Humour lives in the pauses, and, although the scene was funny, it had no place in the final cut. “Do everything that serves the narrative,” says Pawar. In short, never gild the lily.\n\n\n\nBecause it’s an ad, not content.\n\n\n\nThe film is a respite from the flurry of self-indulgent tripe often designed with the misplaced ambition to reflect and/or alter public conscience. Or, worse, created for the sole purpose of stockpiling views and ‘LOLs’. This campaign on the other hand is a hardcore sales pitch. Marketers today are labouring under absurd misapprehensions, that their brands can “control consumer emotions or the nation’s future... brands take themselves too seriously,” says Sinha. And Pawar & co. could have easily gone down that route with Ambuja in an attempt to create connect through “content”, not advertising, which has become quite unfashionable, you see. For instance, a film about how Ambuja has cemented generations of Indians with love or united people separated by artificial constructs like borders. It’s a great time for “storytelling”. But the blind pursuit of shareable content has rendered most of it trite and derivative. The Ambuja-Khali film works because it doesn’t drink the same mediocrity-flavoured Kool-Aid. And it doesn’t pretend to be anything other than an advertisement.\n\nBy ,\n\nET Bureau", "source_link": "https://brandequity.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/advertising/ambuja-cement-the-great-indian-ad-feat-khali/49552519", "keywords": ["The Great Khali", "Ambuja Cement", "Publicis", "Bobby Pawar", "Partha Sinha", "BE This Week"], "tags": ["BE Saal Baad", "BE Cafe", "Bobby Pawar", "Solologues", "Interviews", "Publicis", "Ambuja cement", "Olympics", "Partha Sinha", "BE This Week", "Strategygram", "Martequity", "Ambuja Cement", "The Great Khali"], "article_images": "https://etimg.etb2bimg.com/thumb/msid-49552519,imgsize-32009,width-1200,height=765,overlay-etbrandequity/advertising/ambuja-cement-the-great-indian-ad-feat-khali.jpg", "all_images": ["https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/arrow-right.svg", "https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/linkedin-icon.png", "https://brandequity.economictimes.indiatimes.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/whatsapp-share.svg", "https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/logos/brandequity-logo-mobile-header.svg?mod=2839", "https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/comment-icon.svg?mod=2839", "https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/bar-codes/brandequity_barcode.png?mod=2839", "https://etimg.etb2bimg.com/thumb/msid-49552519,imgsize-32009,width-1200,height=765,overlay-etbrandequity/advertising/ambuja-cement-the-great-indian-ad-feat-khali.jpg", "https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/et-icon.svg", "https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/logos/brandequity-logo-header.svg?mod=2839", "https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/icon-newsletter.svg", "https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/bookmarked-icon.svg", "https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/icon-search.svg", "https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/bookmark-icon-grey.svg?mod=2", "https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/twitter-icon.png", "https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/icon-g-play.png", "https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/app-store-icon.png", "https://brandequity.economictimes.indiatimes.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/facebook-share.svg", "https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/icon-home.svg", "https://brandequity.economictimes.indiatimes.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/copy-icon.svg", "https://brandequity.economictimes.indiatimes.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/telegram-share.svg", "https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/newsletter-icon.webp", "https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/gplay-icon.png", "https://brandequity.economictimes.indiatimes.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/linkedin-share.svg", "https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/icon-reader.svg", "https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/insta-icon.png", "https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/icon-app-store.png", "https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/icon-no-comments.svg", "https://img.etb2bimg.com/files/cp/upload-1716880754-etbrandequity-default.webp", "https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/facebook-icon.png", "https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/logos/brandequity-logo-footer.svg?mod=2839", "https://brandequity.economictimes.indiatimes.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/et-default-user.svg", "https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/icon-share-arrow.png", "https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/youtube-icon.png", "https://brandequity.economictimes.indiatimes.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/twitter-share.svg"], "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "google-site-verification": "ZgFICIedNvVZl5pV9EfAUeenwta9vBY0Za_GgmV4zuw", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "author": "www.ETBrandEquity.com", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Ambuja Cement: The Great Indian Ad feat.

In line with the company’s strategy of continuous innovation is the Alccofine Micro Materials range of products, which complements its strength in the core cement business and helps it cater to specialized applications.\n\nA joint venture between Ambuja Cements and the Alcon Group, Alccofine Micro Materials makes products like AF 1203(under 1200 series), an ultrafine proprietary patented mineral additives used with high-performance concrete that provides long life. This product enhances hydraulic property and pozzolanic reactivity of concrete resulting in enhanced hydration, improved packing density of paste component, lowering water demand, admixture dosage and hence improving strength and durability of the concrete.\n\nThe 1100 series range of products are the microfine injection grout products. This product enables effective penetration of microfine and ultrafine particles deep into strata—or rock layers—to facilitate reduction in permeation properties, curtain grouting for dams and water bodies, and improvement in the bearing capacity of such layers. This finds application in construction of large structures like retaining walls for reservoirs and dams or canals, among others.\n\nAlccofine’s products find application in structures from small to large—be it skyscrapers, metro lines, roads, flyovers, housing complexes, tunnels, large refineries, defence projects or even individual homes. In short, structures that stand—and have stood—the test of time. The products are added to the cement/concrete at the time of construction that improves their durability, enhances resistance of concrete to aggressive environmental agents, among other advantages.\n\nAlccofine’s products already have a wide track record of usage in vital infrastructure projects across India, be it the Kishanganga Hydroelectric power project in Jammu and Kashmir (J&K), and ongoing metro projects in Mumbai, Pune, Surat, Ahmedabad, Kochi, Chennai, New Delhi and Kolkata. Other projects include signature bridges over Mandvi and Zuari rivers in Goa; bridges over Ganga and Brahmaputra in Patna and Guwahati; the trans-harbour bridge in Mumbai, which is India’s longest; major NHAI projects and Hydroelectric dam projects in Himachal Pradesh (HP), J&K and Assam; key defence shipyards and ports; skyscrapers in Mumbai and New Delhi and underground tunnels in Mumbai, Kolkata, J&K, HP and Arunachal Pradesh.\n\nThe company has a manufacturing facility at Goa, which is among the world’s largest for micro-fine materials. The facility also comprises a state-of-the-art laboratory that tests construction materials, which includes long-term durability tests under various parameters.\n\nNeeraj Akhoury, CEO India Holcim and MD & CEO of Ambuja Cements Ltd., said, “Innovating to sustainability has been at the centre of Ambuja Cements’ ethos, and our involvement with Alccofine exemplifies that best. It’s not just enough if we build; we must build to ensure that the structures withstand the test of time. That is the hallmark of sustainability, and that is what we aim to achieve as well. For Ambuja Cements, this is yet another endeavor in the area of sustainability.”", "source_link": "https://www.rprealtyplus.com/allied/ambuja-cements-innovates-in-sustainability-by-producing-construction-materials-of-future-106783.html", "keywords": ["Ambuja Cements", "Alcon Group", "Futuristic Construction Materials", "Neeraj Akhoury", "CEO India Holcim and MD & CEO of Ambuja Cements Ltd."], "tags": [], "article_images": "https://storage.googleapis.com/realtyplusmag-news-photo/news-photo/106783.Alccofine-Micro-Materials.jpg", "all_images": ["https://storage.googleapis.com/realtyplusmag-news-photo/news-photo/118576.South-Africa’s-new-multi-billion-smart-city.jpg", "https://storage.googleapis.com/realtyplusmag-news-photo/news-photo/106783.Alccofine-Micro-Materials.jpg", "https://storage.googleapis.com/realtyplusmag-news-photo/news-photo/118577.trump-wh-ap-rc-200703_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "https://storage.googleapis.com/realtyplusmag-news-photo/news-photo/album/default-staff.png", "https://storage.googleapis.com/realtyplusmag-news-photo/news-photo/epaper/01252025213500-Cover-image---dimension---592-X-774-(1).png", "https://storage.googleapis.com/e4m-news-photo/news-photo/static-images/twitter-logo-large-dark.png", "https://storage.googleapis.com/realtyplusmag-news-photo/news-photo/118578.Naresh-Tyagi,-Chairman-of-the-ICC-National-Expert-Committee-on-Sustainability-and-Chief-Sustainability-Officer,-Aditya-Birla-Fashion-and-Retail-Limited-(1).jpg", "https://www.rprealtyplus.com/img/subscribe-mag.png", "https://storage.googleapis.com/realtyplusmag-news-photo/news-photo/118778.Shree-Cement.png", "https://storage.googleapis.com/realtyplusmag-news-photo/news-photo/118780.Surface-Décor-Dorby.png", "https://storage.googleapis.com/realtyplusmag-news-photo/news-photo/epaper/01072025182910-Cover-image---dimension---592-X-774.png", "https://storage.googleapis.com/realtyplusmag-news-photo/news-photo/118779.SRM.png", "https://storage.googleapis.com/realtyplusmag-news-photo/news-photo/newsletter/11182024180946-Realty-Plus---780x90-Pixels.jpg", "https://www.rprealtyplus.com/images/logo.png"], "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "csrf-token": "6EymzXoNNigCiknG2uzIhB5ueHgdhCRHAFBuZWXQ", "title": "Ambuja Cements Innovates in Sustainability by Producing Construction Materials Of Future", "description": "Ambuja Cements Innovates in Sustainability by Producing Construction Materials Of Future", "keywords": "Ambuja Cements , Alcon Group, Futuristic Construction Materials, Neeraj Akhoury, CEO India Holcim and MD & CEO of Ambuja Cements Ltd.", "news_keywords": "Ambuja Cements , Alcon Group, Futuristic Construction Materials, Neeraj Akhoury, CEO India Holcim and MD & CEO of Ambuja Cements Ltd.", "image_src": "https://storage.googleapis.com/realtyplusmag-news-photo/news-photo/106783.Alccofine-Micro-Materials.jpg", "og": {"title": "Ambuja Cements Innovates in Sustainability by Producing Construction Materials Of Future", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.rprealtyplus.com/allied/ambuja-cements-alcon-group-jv-launches-futuristic-construction-materials-106783.html", "site_name": "Realty Plus Magazine", "image": {"identifier": "https://storage.googleapis.com/realtyplusmag-news-photo/news-photo/106783.Alccofine-Micro-Materials.jpg", "width": 870, "height": 470}, "description": "Ambuja Cements Innovates in Sustainability by Producing Construction Materials Of Future"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "https://twitter.com/RPRealtyPlus", "creator": "@RPRealtyPlus", "title": "Ambuja Cements Innovates in Sustainability by Producing Construction Materials Of Future", "image": {"src": "https://storage.googleapis.com/realtyplusmag-news-photo/news-photo/106783.Alccofine-Micro-Materials.jpg"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/rprealtyplus/"}, "fb": {"app_id": 762410207182368}}, "ambuja_kawach_count": 0, "ambuja_cool_walls_count": 0, "ambuja_compocem_count": 0, "ultratech_weather_pro_flex_count": 0, "shree_aac_blocks_count": 0, "ambuja_plus_count": 0, "ultratech_flex_count": 0, "shree_adhesives_count": 0},

ACEM announced organic clinker/cement capacity expansion of 8mtpa/ 14mtpa in the next 24-months. The company plans to add clinker capacity of 4mtpa (each) at its two existing locations- Bhatapara, Chhattisgarh, and Maratha, Maharashtra. Additionally, the company is increasing grinding capacities in multiple states, including Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Uttar Pradesh, and West Bengal. The company has already placed orders for the main plant and equipment.\n\nACEM’s sales volumes grew 12% YoY (on a like-to-like comparison). The company’s cement capacity utilization stood at 86% in FY23 vs. 82% in CY21. Higher volume growth was aided by accelerated volume under MSA with ACC. The company sold 4.1mt in FY23 (vs 1.1mt in CY21) to ACC under MSA.\n\nFY23 was a challenging year due to cost inflation (higher raw material and fuel prices). Raw material cost/t of cement rose 5% in FY23 vs. CY21 due to an increase in slag and gypsum prices. Power and fuel cost/t raised 26% in FY23 vs. CY21 due to a sharp increase in fuel (both coal and petcoke).\n\nBlended realization improved 2% in FY23 vs. CY21. However, due to significant cost pressures (up 11% in FY23 vs. CY21), EBITDA margin declined to 16% in FY23 vs. 23% in CY21. EBITDA/t stood at INR845 in FY23 vs. INR1,182 in CY21. We estimate EBITDA margin to improve to 20%/23% in FY24/FY25.\n\nIn FY23, it installed cumulative 53MW of WHRS capacity at various locations at a total capex of INR5.5b. While 27.5 MW capacity is at an advanced stage to be commissioned in FY24. It plans to raise WHRS/Solar power capacity to 87.6MW/100MW by FY24, at its existing plants. It is focusing to increase green power share to 43% in total power consumption by FY24.\n\nACEM’s FCF turned negative in FY23 due to lower profitability, higher capex, and advances, under the long-term supply arrangement. In FY23, the company has given advances to a related party (Mundra Petrochem, a subsidiary of Adani Enterprises) for securing rights for raw material/fuel for its upcoming cement plant at Mundra, which is likely to be commissioned in FY26.\n\nGoing forward, we expect OCF to improve in FY24/FY25, led by profitability improvement. However, given the robust expansion plan, we estimate an FCF outflow of INR7b/INR1b in FY24/FY25 (in our current assumptions, we have not considered the recent announcement of acquisition of Sanghi Industries).\n\nACEM announced capacity expansion of 14mtpa in the next 24-months. Looking, ahead the company aims to double its overall capacity by FY28 by involving a combination of greenfield projects, brownfield expansions, and de-bottlenecking efforts. ACEM’s clinker/cement capacity stood at 21mtpa/31.5mtpa; however, with the successful completion of these expansion initiatives, the cement/clinker capacity will increase to 29mtpa/ 45.5mtpa by FY25-end.\n\nRecently, the company has also announced acquisition of Sanghi Industries (SNGI) having clinker/cement capacity of 6.6mtpa/6.1mtpa in Kutch, Gujarat. The acquisition is subject to CCI clearance and other regulatory approvals. ACEM plans to increase SNGI grinding capacity to 10mtpa (from 6.1mtpa currently) with an investment of INR5b by Mar’24 and further expansion to 15mtpa at an investment of INR30b by FY26E.\n\nThe company is taking various cost-optimization initiatives such as adding WHRS/ Solar power plants, ramp-up of coal mining from Gare-Palma IV coal block and Dahegaon Gowari, reduction in lead distance and rail-road mix optimization. The management targets sustainable cost reduction of INR400/t.", "source_link": "https://www.rprealtyplus.com/index.php/allied/ambuja-cements-capacity-expansion-focuses-on-cost-reductions-111752.html", "keywords": ["Ambuja Cements", "capacity", "expansion", "organic clinker", "cement capacity", "sales volumes"], "tags": [], "article_images": "https://storage.googleapis.com/realtyplusmag-news-photo/news-photo/111752.hi.jpg", "all_images": ["https://storage.googleapis.com/realtyplusmag-news-photo/news-photo/118576.South-Africa’s-new-multi-billion-smart-city.jpg", "https://www.rprealtyplus.com/index.php/images/logo.png", "https://storage.googleapis.com/realtyplusmag-news-photo/news-photo/118577.trump-wh-ap-rc-200703_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "https://storage.googleapis.com/realtyplusmag-news-photo/news-photo/album/default-staff.png", "https://storage.googleapis.com/realtyplusmag-news-photo/news-photo/epaper/01252025213500-Cover-image---dimension---592-X-774-(1).png", "https://storage.googleapis.com/e4m-news-photo/news-photo/static-images/twitter-logo-large-dark.png", "https://storage.googleapis.com/realtyplusmag-news-photo/news-photo/118578.Naresh-Tyagi,-Chairman-of-the-ICC-National-Expert-Committee-on-Sustainability-and-Chief-Sustainability-Officer,-Aditya-Birla-Fashion-and-Retail-Limited-(1).jpg", "https://www.rprealtyplus.com/img/subscribe-mag.png", "https://storage.googleapis.com/realtyplusmag-news-photo/news-photo/118778.Shree-Cement.png", "https://storage.googleapis.com/realtyplusmag-news-photo/news-photo/118780.Surface-Décor-Dorby.png", "https://storage.googleapis.com/realtyplusmag-news-photo/news-photo/epaper/01072025182910-Cover-image---dimension---592-X-774.png", "https://storage.googleapis.com/realtyplusmag-news-photo/news-photo/118779.SRM.png", "https://storage.googleapis.com/realtyplusmag-news-photo/news-photo/newsletter/11182024180946-Realty-Plus---780x90-Pixels.jpg", "https://www.rprealtyplus.com/images/logo.png", "https://storage.googleapis.com/realtyplusmag-news-photo/news-photo/111752.hi.jpg"], "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "csrf-token": "UleIoAYomJxnXg8xiEDIHrAix1udgErt5Nb2Lcc9", "title": "Ambuja Cements Capacity Expansion Focuses On Cost Reductions", "description": "Ambuja Cements Capacity Expansion Focuses On Cost Reductions", "keywords": "Ambuja Cements, capacity, expansion, organic clinker, cement capacity, sales volumes", "news_keywords": "Ambuja Cements, capacity, expansion, organic clinker, cement capacity, sales volumes", "image_src": "https://storage.googleapis.com/realtyplusmag-news-photo/news-photo/111752.hi.jpg", "og": {"title": "Ambuja Cements Capacity Expansion Focuses On Cost Reductions", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.rprealtyplus.com/allied/ambuja-cements-capacity-expansion-focuses-on-cost-reductions-111752.html", "site_name": "Realty Plus Magazine", "image": {"identifier": "https://storage.googleapis.com/realtyplusmag-news-photo/news-photo/111752.hi.jpg", "width": 870, "height": 470}, "description": "Ambuja Cements Capacity Expansion Focuses On Cost Reductions"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "https://twitter.com/RPRealtyPlus", "creator": "@RPRealtyPlus", "title": "Ambuja Cements Capacity Expansion Focuses On Cost Reductions", "image": {"src": "https://storage.googleapis.com/realtyplusmag-news-photo/news-photo/111752.hi.jpg"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/rprealtyplus/"}, "fb": {"app_id": 762410207182368}}, "ambuja_kawach_count": 0, "ambuja_cool_walls_count": 0, "ambuja_compocem_count": 0, "ultratech_weather_pro_flex_count": 0, "shree_aac_blocks_count": 0, "ambuja_plus_count": 0, "ultratech_flex_count": 0, "shree_adhesives_count": 0},

The e-auction was conducted by the Housing Infrastructure Development Corporation (HIDCO). Sources from the real-estate sector said there were two bidders for Plot No. 651(Part), Mouza Nonadanga, J L No. 10, Premises/Holding No. 826 at Chowbhaga under KMC Ward 108.\n\nThe city has been witnessing land parcels fetching high prices since 2006. That year, all previous land-selling records were broken when KMDA sold a 6.2-acre plot off EM Bypass to a real estate company for a hotel project for Rs 209 crore.\n\nGovernment officials said that after a gap of several years, the real estate market in the city was witnessing huge growth. The state government is trying to generate revenue through land transfers on a freehold basis. Earlier this year, a 5.6-acre plot at Alipore fetched over Rs 400 crore. In Rajarhat too, a bid of Rs 203 crore was offered for a 6.2-acre land.", "source_link": "https://www.rprealtyplus.com/allied/ambuja-neotia-group-highest-bidder-for-10-acre-plot-near-em-bypass-108984.html", "keywords": ["Ambuja Neotia Group", "highest", "bidder", "acre", "plant", "officials", "government"], "tags": [], "article_images": "https://storage.googleapis.com/realtyplusmag-news-photo/news-photo/108984.Ambuja-Neotia-Group-Highest-Bidder-for-10-Acre-Plot-Near-EM-Bypass.jpg", "all_images": ["https://storage.googleapis.com/realtyplusmag-news-photo/news-photo/118576.South-Africa’s-new-multi-billion-smart-city.jpg", "https://storage.googleapis.com/realtyplusmag-news-photo/news-photo/118577.trump-wh-ap-rc-200703_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "https://storage.googleapis.com/realtyplusmag-news-photo/news-photo/album/default-staff.png", "https://storage.googleapis.com/realtyplusmag-news-photo/news-photo/epaper/01252025213500-Cover-image---dimension---592-X-774-(1).png", "https://storage.googleapis.com/e4m-news-photo/news-photo/static-images/twitter-logo-large-dark.png", "https://storage.googleapis.com/realtyplusmag-news-photo/news-photo/118578.Naresh-Tyagi,-Chairman-of-the-ICC-National-Expert-Committee-on-Sustainability-and-Chief-Sustainability-Officer,-Aditya-Birla-Fashion-and-Retail-Limited-(1).jpg", "https://storage.googleapis.com/realtyplusmag-news-photo/news-photo/108984.Ambuja-Neotia-Group-Highest-Bidder-for-10-Acre-Plot-Near-EM-Bypass.jpg", "https://www.rprealtyplus.com/img/subscribe-mag.png", "https://storage.googleapis.com/realtyplusmag-news-photo/news-photo/118778.Shree-Cement.png", "https://storage.googleapis.com/realtyplusmag-news-photo/news-photo/118780.Surface-Décor-Dorby.png", "https://storage.googleapis.com/realtyplusmag-news-photo/news-photo/epaper/01072025182910-Cover-image---dimension---592-X-774.png", "https://storage.googleapis.com/realtyplusmag-news-photo/news-photo/118779.SRM.png", "https://storage.googleapis.com/realtyplusmag-news-photo/news-photo/newsletter/11182024180946-Realty-Plus---780x90-Pixels.jpg", "https://www.rprealtyplus.com/images/logo.png"], "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "csrf-token": "93zq5xFpt6f82QEtTGXgGsWao0pEOF83XEJNPeGN", "title": "Ambuja Neotia Group Highest Bidder for 10-Acre Plot Near EM Bypass", "description": "Ambuja Neotia Group Highest Bidder for 10-Acre Plot Near EM Bypass", "keywords": "Ambuja Neotia Group, highest, bidder, acre, plant, officials, government", "news_keywords": "Ambuja Neotia Group, highest, bidder, acre, plant, officials, government", "image_src": "https://storage.googleapis.com/realtyplusmag-news-photo/news-photo/108984.Ambuja-Neotia-Group-Highest-Bidder-for-10-Acre-Plot-Near-EM-Bypass.jpg", "og": {"title": "Ambuja Neotia Group Highest Bidder for 10-Acre Plot Near EM Bypass", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.rprealtyplus.com/allied/ambuja-neotia-group-highest-bidder-for-10-acre-plot-near-em-bypass-108984.html", "site_name": "Realty Plus Magazine", "image": {"identifier": "https://storage.googleapis.com/realtyplusmag-news-photo/news-photo/108984.Ambuja-Neotia-Group-Highest-Bidder-for-10-Acre-Plot-Near-EM-Bypass.jpg", "width": 870, "height": 470}, "description": "Ambuja Neotia Group Highest Bidder for 10-Acre Plot Near EM Bypass"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "https://twitter.com/RPRealtyPlus", "creator": "@RPRealtyPlus", "title": "Ambuja Neotia Group Highest Bidder for 10-Acre Plot Near EM Bypass", "image": {"src": "https://storage.googleapis.com/realtyplusmag-news-photo/news-photo/108984.Ambuja-Neotia-Group-Highest-Bidder-for-10-Acre-Plot-Near-EM-Bypass.jpg"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/rprealtyplus/"}, "fb": {"app_id": 762410207182368}}, "ambuja_kawach_count": 0, "ambuja_cool_walls_count": 0, "ambuja_compocem_count": 0, "ultratech_weather_pro_flex_count": 0, "shree_aac_blocks_count": 0, "ambuja_plus_count": 0, "ultratech_flex_count": 0, "shree_adhesives_count": 0},

This will remain a key focus area for Ambuja Cements as it aims to reshape the way the company operates—from running the plants to managing logistics and supply chains and ensuring customer connect.\n\nTo this end, the company has invested in its ‘Plants of Tomorrow’ initiative, which aims to make manufacturing more efficient through better plant optimisation, higher plant availability and a safer working environment. Under the initiative, the company will enhance operational efficiency significantly in comparison to conventional cement plants.\n\nMoreover, the company’s Transport Analytics Center is helping the company enhance logistics efficiency through route optimisation, cost optimisation and increased road safety. This centre is being used to detect deviations on the ground and it has now become the single source of data for the entire supply chain.\n\nThe entire Quality control and Process optimisation at Marwar Cement Works is guided by a state-of-the-art robotic lab, which has a huge number of auto sampling points. Collected samples are transported to lab for analysis with absolute accuracy guaranteed without any human intervention. Automated sampling has eliminated hazards associated with physical sampling besides creating a dust-free environment in labs and sample rooms. Such technology not only saves time, but also improves the efficiency.\n\nNeeraj Akhoury, CEO India Holcim and MD & CEO of Ambuja Cements Ltd., said, “We at Ambuja Cements aim to digitalize the entire operations of the company. Our key strategy is to strengthen the ‘green’ plant across our units and manage our operations with improved efficiency. We visualize a plant with efficient technology, automation and digitization.”\n\nAmbuja Cements continues ramping up the use of digital technologies to optimize operations and ensure maximum efficacy. The cement maker has also adopted a digital first and consumer-centric approach towards improving business outreach.", "source_link": "https://www.rprealtyplus.com/index.php/allied/ambuja-cements-boosts-efficiency-at-plants-through-digital-initiatives-106546.html", "keywords": ["Neeraj Akhoury", "CEO India Holcim and MD & CEO of Ambuja Cements Ltd.", "Transport Analytics Center", "Digital Initiatives", "Plants of Tomorrow"], "tags": [], "article_images": "https://storage.googleapis.com/realtyplusmag-news-photo/news-photo/106546.ambuja.jpg", "all_images": ["https://storage.googleapis.com/realtyplusmag-news-photo/news-photo/118576.South-Africa’s-new-multi-billion-smart-city.jpg", "https://www.rprealtyplus.com/index.php/images/logo.png", "https://storage.googleapis.com/realtyplusmag-news-photo/news-photo/106546.ambuja.jpg", "https://storage.googleapis.com/realtyplusmag-news-photo/news-photo/118577.trump-wh-ap-rc-200703_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "https://storage.googleapis.com/realtyplusmag-news-photo/news-photo/album/default-staff.png", "https://storage.googleapis.com/realtyplusmag-news-photo/news-photo/epaper/01252025213500-Cover-image---dimension---592-X-774-(1).png", "https://storage.googleapis.com/e4m-news-photo/news-photo/static-images/twitter-logo-large-dark.png", "https://storage.googleapis.com/realtyplusmag-news-photo/news-photo/118578.Naresh-Tyagi,-Chairman-of-the-ICC-National-Expert-Committee-on-Sustainability-and-Chief-Sustainability-Officer,-Aditya-Birla-Fashion-and-Retail-Limited-(1).jpg", "https://www.rprealtyplus.com/img/subscribe-mag.png", "https://storage.googleapis.com/realtyplusmag-news-photo/news-photo/118778.Shree-Cement.png", "https://storage.googleapis.com/realtyplusmag-news-photo/news-photo/118780.Surface-Décor-Dorby.png", "https://storage.googleapis.com/realtyplusmag-news-photo/news-photo/epaper/01072025182910-Cover-image---dimension---592-X-774.png", "https://storage.googleapis.com/realtyplusmag-news-photo/news-photo/118779.SRM.png", "https://storage.googleapis.com/realtyplusmag-news-photo/news-photo/newsletter/11182024180946-Realty-Plus---780x90-Pixels.jpg", "https://www.rprealtyplus.com/images/logo.png"], "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "csrf-token": "AjYKnPlamfFiKTkbgE9SIIk468tiYGZYj2FJR2GQ", "title": "Ambuja Cements Boosts Efficiency at Plants through Digital Initiatives", "description": "Ambuja Cements Boosts Efficiency at Plants through Digital Initiatives", "keywords": "Neeraj Akhoury, CEO India Holcim and MD & CEO of Ambuja Cements Ltd., Transport Analytics Center, Digital Initiatives, Plants of Tomorrow", "news_keywords": "Neeraj Akhoury, CEO India Holcim and MD & CEO of Ambuja Cements Ltd., Transport Analytics Center, Digital Initiatives, Plants of Tomorrow", "image_src": "https://storage.googleapis.com/realtyplusmag-news-photo/news-photo/106546.ambuja.jpg", "og": {"title": "Ambuja Cements Boosts Efficiency at Plants through Digital Initiatives", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.rprealtyplus.com/allied/ambuja-cements-boosts-efficiency-at-plants-through-digital-initiatives-106546.html", "site_name": "Realty Plus Magazine", "image": {"identifier": "https://storage.googleapis.com/realtyplusmag-news-photo/news-photo/106546.ambuja.jpg", "width": 870, "height": 470}, "description": "Ambuja Cements Boosts Efficiency at Plants through Digital Initiatives"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "https://twitter.com/RPRealtyPlus", "creator": "@RPRealtyPlus", "title": "Ambuja Cements Boosts Efficiency at Plants through Digital Initiatives", "image": {"src": "https://storage.googleapis.com/realtyplusmag-news-photo/news-photo/106546.ambuja.jpg"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/rprealtyplus/"}, "fb": {"app_id": 762410207182368}}, "ambuja_kawach_count": 0, "ambuja_cool_walls_count": 0, "ambuja_compocem_count": 0, "ultratech_weather_pro_flex_count": 0, "shree_aac_blocks_count": 0, "ambuja_plus_count": 0, "ultratech_flex_count": 0, "shree_adhesives_count": 0},

The aim is to generate clean and green energy in line with LafargeHolcim’s Net Zero Pledge and its ambition to reduce emissions from electricity. The decarbonisation agenda will be delivered through a number of measures, from waste heat recovery to using more renewable energy and reducing the amount of clinker used in cement manufacture. “We have been consistently striving to set new benchmarks in sustainable construction in India. Our approach to achieve this goal encompasses the three Ps: People, Planet and Profit. By adopting these decarbonisation measures, both ACC and Ambuja are giving momentum to their global net zero journey. As an advocate of strategic sustainability goals, we will continue to focus on responsible manufacturing and production.” said, Neeraj Akhoury, CEO LafargeHolcim India and Managing Director & CEO, Ambuja Cements Limited. The companies are also actively partnering with power producers to install renewable energy facilities across its sites and increase its share of renewable energy from the grid. In addition to further reducing their carbon footprint, Ambuja and ACC have also adopted the use of solar power in their cement manufacturing process. Both companies have undertaken several CO2 reduction measures such as clinker factor reduction, thermal substitution rate, thermal & electrical energy efficiency, renewable energy and adoption of new technologies. Both companies have comparatively low specific CO2 emissions in the world with about 530 kg and 512 kg CO2 per ton of cementitious material for Ambuja Cement and ACC respectively. Together they are striving to further reduce their carbon emissions intensity to help reach LafargeHolcim’s sector-leading 2030 targets. To drive sustainability through technology, the WHRS will be in installed at Ambuja Cements plants in Bhatapara (Chattisgarh), Suli and Rauri (Himachal Pradesh) and Marwar Mundwa (Rajasthan); and ACC plants in Jamul (Chattisgarh) and Kymore (Madhya Pradesh). All projects are slated to be completed within the next 2 months. The investment of Rs. 780 crores in WHRS adding over 76 MW capacity across six sites will be completed in the next two years.", "source_link": "https://www.rprealtyplus.com/index.php/allied/acc-ambuja-cements-accelerate-decarbonisation-agenda-90668.html", "keywords": ["ALLIED", "Cement", "Ambuja Cements'", "ACC", "Accelerate", "Decarbonisation Agenda"], "tags": [], "article_images": "https://storage.googleapis.com/realtyplusmag-news-photo/news-photo/Cement-strong.jpg", "all_images": ["https://storage.googleapis.com/realtyplusmag-news-photo/news-photo/118576.South-Africa’s-new-multi-billion-smart-city.jpg", "https://www.rprealtyplus.com/index.php/images/logo.png", "https://storage.googleapis.com/realtyplusmag-news-photo/news-photo/118577.trump-wh-ap-rc-200703_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "https://storage.googleapis.com/realtyplusmag-news-photo/news-photo/album/default-staff.png", "https://storage.googleapis.com/realtyplusmag-news-photo/news-photo/epaper/01252025213500-Cover-image---dimension---592-X-774-(1).png", "https://storage.googleapis.com/e4m-news-photo/news-photo/static-images/twitter-logo-large-dark.png", "https://storage.googleapis.com/realtyplusmag-news-photo/news-photo/Cement-strong.jpg", "https://storage.googleapis.com/realtyplusmag-news-photo/news-photo/118578.Naresh-Tyagi,-Chairman-of-the-ICC-National-Expert-Committee-on-Sustainability-and-Chief-Sustainability-Officer,-Aditya-Birla-Fashion-and-Retail-Limited-(1).jpg", "https://www.rprealtyplus.com/img/subscribe-mag.png", "https://storage.googleapis.com/realtyplusmag-news-photo/news-photo/118778.Shree-Cement.png", "https://storage.googleapis.com/realtyplusmag-news-photo/news-photo/118780.Surface-Décor-Dorby.png", "https://storage.googleapis.com/realtyplusmag-news-photo/news-photo/epaper/01072025182910-Cover-image---dimension---592-X-774.png", "https://storage.googleapis.com/realtyplusmag-news-photo/news-photo/118779.SRM.png", "https://storage.googleapis.com/realtyplusmag-news-photo/news-photo/newsletter/11182024180946-Realty-Plus---780x90-Pixels.jpg", "https://www.rprealtyplus.com/images/logo.png"], "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "csrf-token": "v12G11morYCTlJhNGoGVRcnxkpRdKMzSDcE35ttx", "title": "ACC & Ambuja Cements Accelerate Decarbonisation Agenda", "description": "Ambuja Cement and ACC – both operating companies of leading global building material and solutions organisation LafargeHolcim – have collectively accelerated their decarbonisation agenda.

With 59% stake, public companies possess the maximum shares in the company. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).\n\nAnd institutions on the other hand have a 24% ownership in the company. Large companies usually have institutions as shareholders, and we usually see insiders owning shares in smaller companies.\n\nLet's delve deeper into each type of owner of UltraTech Cement, beginning with the chart below.\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About UltraTech Cement?\n\nInstitutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.\n\nUltraTech Cement already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of UltraTech Cement, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.\n\nHedge funds don't have many shares in UltraTech Cement. Grasim Industries Limited is currently the largest shareholder, with 57% of shares outstanding. This implies that they have majority interest control of the future of the company. Life Insurance Corporation of India, Asset Management Arm is the second largest shareholder owning 2.3% of common stock, and ICICI Prudential Asset Management Company Limited holds about 2.0% of the company stock.\n\nWhile it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.\n\nInsider Ownership Of UltraTech Cement\n\nWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.\n\nMost consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.\n\nOur data suggests that insiders own under 1% of UltraTech Cement Limited in their own names. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own ₹4.8b worth of shares (at current prices). In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to\n\nGeneral Public Ownership\n\nThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 14% stake in UltraTech Cement. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.\n\nPublic Company Ownership\n\nWe can see that public companies hold 59% of the UltraTech Cement shares on issue. This may be a strategic interest and the two companies may have related business interests. It could be that they have de-merged.

Srinivasan and other promoters of the South-based cement maker have stepped down.\n\nThe Aditya Birla Group firm has completed the acquisition of 10.13 crore equity shares of India Cements Ltd (ICL), representing 32.72% of the equity share capital of the company.\n\n\"This, together with the existing shareholding of 7.05 crore equity shares (22.77%) of the equity share capital of ICL, has resulted in the Company’s shareholding increasing to 17.19 crore equity shares representing 55.49% of ICL's equity share capital,\" UltraTech had informed in a late-night regulatory filing on Tuesday (December 24, 2024).\n\nConsequently, ICL \"has become a subsidiary of the Company\" with effect from December 24, 2024, it added.\n\nOn Wednesday (December 25, 2024), ICL informed that pursuant to the completion of the transaction and due to the consequent cessation of control by the existing promoters over the company, N Srinivasan has stepped down as Vice Chairman and Managing Director.\n\nBesides, his daughter Rupa Gurunath, wife Chitra Srinivasan and V.M. Mohan have also stepped down from the board of the company, according to a regulatory filing by ICL.\n\nMoreover, \"pursuant to the consummation of the Transaction on December 24 2024, UltraTech has acquired sole control of the company and has become the promoter of the company in accordance with the LODR Regulations\", informed ICL.\n\n“Further, the board also recorded the resignation of certain independent directors - S Balasubramanian Adityan, Krishna Srivastava, Lakshmi Aparna Sreekumar and Sandhya Rajan with effect from the end of business hours on December 25, 2024,” it added.\n\nThe board has also appointed four new directors - K.C. Jhanwar, Vivek Agrawal, E.R. Raj Narayanan and Ashok Ramachandran. Besides, three independent directors - Alka Bharucha, Vikas Balia and Sukanya Kripalu - have come on board of ICL.\n\nLast week, the Competition Commission of India (CCI) cleared over ₹7,000-crore deal, wherein billionaire Kumar Mangalam Birla promoted UltraTech Cement had proposed to acquire a majority stake in India Cements Ltd.\n\n“The fair trade regulator also granted its clearance to UltraTech Cement to acquire up to 26 per cent of the paid-up equity share capital of India Cements by way of an open offer,” it added.\n\nOn July 28, UltraTech Cement announced the acquisition of a 32.72% stake in India Cements Ltd (ICL) from promoters and their associates in a Rs 3,954-crore deal, which will expand its footprint in the highly competitive and fast-growing southern cement market.\n\nBesides, Ultratech has also announced a ₹3,142.35 crore open offer to acquire 26 per cent share of ICL from its shareholders.\n\nEarlier, in June UltraTech acquired 23% shares of ICL.\n\nIt had acquired Damani-group’s stake in India Cements Ltd (ICL) through two block deals in a deal which is estimated to be around ₹1,900 crore.\n\nThe Indian cement industry is witnessing consolidation and heightened rivalry between two corporate houses — Kumar Mangalam Birla-led Aditya Birla Group and Gautam Adani-led Adani Group — snapping smaller players.\n\nThe Adani group has plans in the works to raise its production capacity to 140 MTPA by FY28, just a shade below market leader UltraTech's current capacity of 156.66 MTPA of grey cement.\n\nAdani Cement recently announced the acquisition of CK Birla group firm Orient Cement, through which it will achieve a capacity of 100 MT (million Tones) per annum by the end of FY25 and a gain of 2% in the overall market share in the country.\n\nIt has completed the acquisition of Saurashtra-based Sanghi Industries, and Penna Industries and recently announced the acquisition of C.K. Birla group firm Orient Cement as part of its inorganic growth strategy.\n\nAditya Birla Group also plans to maintain its lead with 200 MTPA capacity by FY27. UltraTech is also in the process of acquiring Kesoram Industries' cement business and is awaiting regulatory clearance.", "source_link": "https://www.thehindu.com/business/india-cements-promoter-n-srinivasan-steps-down-as-ultratech-completes-acquisition/article69027007.ece", "keywords": ["UltraTech cement", "N.

As the second-largest cement producer globally, it significantly contributes to India’s GDP, industrial output, and employment. With an installed capacity of around 690 million tpy, the sector plays a crucial role in housing, transportation, and urban infrastructure. Cement production for FY23 – 24 is estimated at 390 million tpy, reflecting steady demand supported by government initiatives and private investments.\n\nThe industry’s growth has been marked by substantial capacity additions, with over 15 million tpy added in 2022 – 23 by major players like UltraTech Cement, Shree Cement, and ACC-Ambuja. However, capacity utilisation is mixed, averaging 65 – 70%, with North and East India operating at near 80%, while the South faces overcapacity with utilisation as low as 50 – 55%.\n\nHousing accounts for 60% of cement consumption, followed by infrastructure projects (25%) and commercial real estate (15%). Government programmes like Bharatmala, Sagarmala, and Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY) are major drivers, with demand expected to exceed 500 million tpy by 2030. Urbanisation – projected to reach 40% by 2030 – further fuels the demand for robust infrastructure, solidifying the industry's importance.\n\nIndian cement plants are among the most energy-efficient globally, achieving thermal energy consumption levels of 725 kcal/kg of clinker and electrical energy usage of 75 kWh/t of cement. Advanced technologies like waste heat recovery (WHR) systems and digital automation have reduced production costs and environmental impact, meeting global sustainability benchmarks.\n\nThe industry is also prioritising green technologies and low-carbon solutions, focusing on reducing clinker factor and increasing alternative fuel (AF) use. These efforts reflect the sector's commitment to balancing economic growth with environmental responsibility, ensuring its continued importance in India’s infrastructure and economic aspirations.\n\nThe current landscape of the Indian cement industry\n\nThe Indian cement industry, with an installed capacity of approximately 590 million tpy as of FY23 – 24, is the second-largest globally, behind China. Production for FY23 – 24 is estimated at 390 million tpy, with sector-wide utilisation rates averaging 65 – 70%. However, regional variations exist, with northern and eastern regions operating near 80% due to strong infrastructure demand, while southern regions face overcapacity, with utilisation rates as low as 50 – 55%.\n\nConsumption trends and drivers\n\nCement consumption in India is influenced by both rural and urban demand. Rural areas account for 40% of total consumption, driven by home building and government housing schemes like PMAY, while urban areas contribute the remaining 60%, spurred by infrastructure, commercial real estate, and industrial projects. Housing remains the dominant sector, absorbing around 60% of cement production, followed by infrastructure projects (25%), driven by initiatives like:\n\nBharatmala Pariyojana: developing 34 800 km of highways by 2027.\n\nSagarmala programme: modernising 577 ports.\n\nSmart cities mission: urban development in 100 cities.\n\nCommercial real estate and industrial sectors make up the remaining 15%, backed by private sector investments.\n\nKey players and market distribution\n\nThe industry is led by major players like UltraTech Cement, Ambuja Cements, ACC, Shree Cement, and Dalmia Bharat, which collectively account for over 60% of total production. The recent merger of Ambuja and ACC under the Adani Group has reshaped market dynamics, intensifying competition, particularly with UltraTech. Regional players like Ramco Cements, JK Cement, and the India Cements cater to specific regional markets.\n\nRegional disparities in production and consumption\n\nNorthern and western regions benefit from balanced demand and supply dynamics, supported by infrastructure activity and urbanisation. Eastern India faces strong demand but struggles with logistical constraints. In contrast, Southern India is burdened with excess capacity, leading to price wars and lower profitability.\n\nTechnological advancements and manufacturing excellence\n\nIndian cement plants are globally recognised for their energy efficiency. Thermal energy consumption averages 725 kcal/kg of clinker, and electrical energy usage is 75 kWh/t of cement, both among the best globally. Investments in WHR systems have surged, covering 20 – 25% of power requirements. The industry is also adopting digital technologies such as predictive analytics, IoT, and process automation to improve productivity and reduce operational costs.\n\nEmerging trends in consumption patterns\n\nBlended cements like Portland Pozzolana Cement (PPC) and Portland Slag Cement (PSC) are gaining popularity, driven by sustainability awareness, government regulations, and rising raw material costs. Demand for these greener alternatives is expected to grow by 7 – 8% annually, aligning with the global shift toward carbon-neutral construction practices.\n\nKey challenges facing the industry\n\nThe Indian cement industry, despite its importance in infrastructure and economic growth, faces significant challenges, primarily due to rising input costs and operational issues that impact profitability, production efficiency, and quality.\n\nEnjoyed what you've read so far?

As the new majority stakeholder in India Cements, UltraTech intends to implement targeted measures such as debottlenecking at key plants and expanding operations at select locations, to steer the Chennai-based cement maker — now a subsidiary — to profitability.\n\nIndia Cements, which became a subsidiary of UltraTech on December 24, 2024, reported a loss of ₹429 crore for the December 2024 quarter, compared to a ₹17 crore loss in the same period last year. Net sales fell to ₹903 crore from ₹1,082 crore. For the nine months of this fiscal, the company recorded a net loss of ₹592 crore (up from a net loss of ₹173 crore in Q3FY24), with net sales dropping to ₹2,891 crore from ₹3,697 crore.\n\nUltraTech is actively working with its team at India Cements to identify growth opportunities. Initial reviews have revealed potential debottlenecking opportunities at three plants and expansion prospects at two or three additional sites. The company aims to enhance ICL’s performance within 12 months, beginning January 2025, the management of UltraTech said during its Q3FY25 earnings call.\n\nThe investment will be required for waste heat recovery systems (WHRS), which are expected to yield returns over time. “If work begins in January 2025, we expect to see benefits by the October–December 2026 quarter. We anticipate some improvements by the end of FY25, with further enhancements once efficiency-driven capital expenditure (CapEx) programmes are completed,” the management added.\n\nIndia Cements operated at around 57% capacity utilisation in the last quarter, highlighting a clear opportunity to improve this metric across its total capacity of 14.45 million tonnes — 13 million tonnes of which are in the South and 1.5 million tonnes in the North.\n\nThe company is also considering return-based capital expenditure, although UltraTech noted that it has only been involved with ICL since December 25, 2024. The company expects to finalise its comprehensive strategy within a quarter.\n\nUltraTech’s recent open offer for India Cements concluded on January 21, saw a subscription of 110 per cent at ₹390 per share. As a result, UltraTech now holds 81.49 per cent equity in India Cements. However, to comply with regulatory requirements, it will reduce its stake to 75 per cent within the prescribed timelines, bringing the average cost of equity to ₹359 per share.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, India Cements’ net debt stood at ₹877 crore, with an enterprise value of ₹12,075 crore for a 14.45 million tonne capacity. The dollar-per-tonne acquisition cost is well below $100, contrary to earlier speculation of $120. Additionally, the debt will be reduced through cash generated from non-core assets, the management said.\n\nOn the branding front, UltraTech confirmed there is no ongoing cricket partnership. The CSK (Chennai Super Kings) association was separated some time ago, and there are no IPL-related ties at present. India Cements will continue to own and manage brands like CSK Cement, but there will be no future cricket-related sponsorships or partnerships.", "source_link":

The growth was driven by higher sales volumes and better price realisations across its segments.Following the announcement, UltraTech Cement's share price went up by almost 6 per cent to Rs 11,333 on the NSE, extending the gains it made before the results.UltraTech's consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) dropped 8 per cent year-on-year to Rs 3,131 crore.However, its operating EBITDA per tonne for domestic grey cement improved sequentially to Rs 964. The realisation per tonne for grey cement declined 9.6 per cent year-on-year but saw a slight quarter-on-quarter improvement of 1.4per cent, reaching Rs 4,970.The company saw growth in cement sales volumes. Domestic grey cement sales increased by 10.5 per cent year-on-year to 28.1 million tonnes, supported by rising demand in rural areas and government spending on infrastructure, it informed in the exchange filing. Additionally, white cement and ReadyMix Concrete (RMC) volumes grew by 6 per cent and 14 per cent, respectively.UltraTech also reported lower logistics and fuel costs due to shorter delivery distances, improved efficiencies, and a higher use of green power. The share of green power rose to 33.4 per cent in Q3 FY25, compared to 24.1 per cent a year earlier.The recent acquisition of India Cements Limited, effective December 24, 2024, added 14.45 million tonnes to UltraTech's grey cement capacity.The company's total domestic grey cement capacity is now projected to reach 209.3 million tonnes by FY27.", "source_link": "https://energy.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/coal/ultratech-cements-q3-profit-falls-over-17-pc-at-rs-1470-crore/117504972", "keywords": ["UltraTech Cement Q3 profit", "UltraTech Cement financial results", "UltraTech Cement stock price", "UltraTech Cement revenue growth", "UltraTech Cement grey cement sales"], "tags": ["Infographics", "Environment", "UltraTech Cement revenue growth", "UltraTech Cement Q3 profit", "UltraTech Cement stock price", "Companies", "UltraTech Cement financial results", "UltraTech Cement grey cement sales", "Economy"], "article_images": "https://etimg.etb2bimg.com/thumb/msid-117504972,imgsize-37730,width-1200,height=765,overlay-etenergy/coal/ultratech-cements-q3-profit-falls-over-17-pc-at-rs-1470-crore.jpg", "all_images": ["https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/arrow-right.svg", "https://energy.economictimes.indiatimes.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/linkedin-share.svg", "https://etimg.etb2bimg.com/thumb/msid-117504972,imgsize-37730,width-1200,height=765,overlay-etenergy/coal/ultratech-cements-q3-profit-falls-over-17-pc-at-rs-1470-crore.jpg", "https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/linkedin-icon.png", "https://energy.economictimes.indiatimes.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/copy-icon.svg", "https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/comment-icon.svg?mod=2839", "https://energy.economictimes.indiatimes.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/telegram-share.svg", "https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/et-icon.svg", "https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/icon-newsletter.svg", "https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/bookmarked-icon.svg", "https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/icon-search.svg", "https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/bookmark-icon-grey.svg?mod=2", "https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/twitter-icon.png", "https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/icon-g-play.png", "https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/app-store-icon.png", "https://img.etb2bimg.com/files/cp/upload-1716881890-etenergyworld.webp", "https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/icon-home.svg", "https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/bar-codes/energy_barcode.png?mod=2839", "https://energy.economictimes.indiatimes.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/facebook-share.svg", "https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/logos/energy-logo-mobile-header.svg?mod=2839", "https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/logos/energy-logo-footer.svg?mod=2839", "https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/newsletter-icon.webp", "https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/logos/energy-logo-header.svg?mod=2839", "https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/gplay-icon.png", "https://energy.economictimes.indiatimes.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/twitter-share.svg", "https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/insta-icon.png", "https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/icon-app-store.png", "https://energy.economictimes.indiatimes.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/whatsapp-share.svg", "https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/icon-no-comments.svg", "https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/facebook-icon.png", "https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/icon-share-arrow.png", "https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/youtube-icon.png", "https://st.etb2bimg.com/Themes/Release/theme4/images/icons/icon-reader.svg"], "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "google-site-verification": "ZgFICIedNvVZl5pV9EfAUeenwta9vBY0Za_GgmV4zuw", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "author": "www.ETEnergyworld.com", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "UltraTech Cement's Q3 profit falls over 17 pc at Rs 1,470 crore -

This deal also included 26% of India Cements’ paid-up equity share capital through an open offer to public shareholders, as per the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeover) Regulations, 2011 (amended).\n\n“The UltraTech acquisition of India Cements, which necessitated a form 2 merger notification, represented many firsts under the amended merger control regime — it was the CCI and the industry’s first form 2 filed under the amended merger regime,” said partner Nisha Kaur Uberoi, who co-led the deal team.\n\n“As UltraTech’s sole counsel, we were able to successfully convince the CCI and demonstrate via competition impact assessment and economic assessment reasons why the transaction should be unconditionally approved in spite of the issuance of the show cause notice, given [the] highly contestable markets that parties operate in.”\n\nThe CCI unconditionally approved the transaction in phase 1, based on arguments presented during the hearing. This approval, achieved in a record-breaking 25 days, established the deal as a significant precedent in merger control.\n\nPartners Uberoi and Pranav Satyam led the JSA team, with help from associates across multiple locations. Other advisers included RKS (Shyam) Khemani and Nexdigm.\n\nThe acquisition aims to expand UltraTech’s footprint in the fragmented and competitive southern market, particularly in Tamil Nadu, where it currently has a presence.\n\nUltraTech Cement is a part of the Aditya Birla Group, India’s largest manufacturer of grey cement, ready-mix concrete and white cement. With a robust footprint across India and international markets, UltraTech operates 23 integrated plants, 27 grinding units and seven bulk terminals.\n\nIndia Cements, is one of the country’s leading cement producers, with a strong presence in the southern region. Operating multiple integrated manufacturing plants and grinding units, it caters to infrastructure and construction needs across the country apart from working in energy, shipping and trading.",

The stake was worth around ₹3,381 crore at the stock’s closing price on January 24.Moneycontrol reported on October 7 that Heidelberg had drawn interest from major Indian cement makers such as Adani group and JSW Cement as well as UltraTech . The Economic Times also reported on October 7 that Adani group had begun talks with Heidelberg for the acquisition of its India assets.A controlling stake sale will trigger a mandatory open offer under SEBI’s takeover norms, for acquiring a 26% stake from public shareholders.In response to Moneycontrol's query, HeidelbergCement said in an email that it does not respond to or comment on \"market rumours\". Emails sent to UltraTech did not elicit a response.UltraTech’s plans to acquire a controlling stake in Heidelberg comes as the country’s biggest cement maker steps up focus on inorganic growth amid consolidation in the cement industry triggered by Adani group’s $6.6-billion acquisition of Ambuja Cements and ACC Limited in 2022 from Lafarge-Holcim.Adani’s aggressive growth strategy has prompted other companies to chase smaller cement makers, as they look to protect their turf and expand into newer markets.On the other hand, the increased competition in the Indian cement market is forcing mid-sized players into consolidation. The increased competition and new manufacturing capacity addition outpacing demand, are expected to also adversely affect margins of smaller cement players as larger players have better cost efficiencies and profitability due to economies of scale.In 2024, UltraTech acquired a 55.49% stake in Chennai-based India Cements. It picked up a 22.7% stake in India Cements in June.

Even as Q3 profit declined, the firm beat CNBC-TV18 poll estimates across parameters.In a note following Q3 earnings, Equirus said that UltraTech remains its top cement pick and that it remains bullish on the stock given the firm’s strong cash flow generation and good leverage position.The cement maker’s sustained focus on cost control and aggression in timely capacity additions are key positives, it said. The brokerage retained its long call on the stock and set the target price at ₹13,490, implying a potential upside of 18% from the closing price of January 23.The brokerage commentary comes after the firm's revenue in Q3 rose 3% YoY to ₹17,193 crore , profit declined 17% to ₹1,473 crore, EBITDA fell to ₹2,888 crore and margin was down to 17%.Of the 42 analysts that have coverage on UltraTech Cement shares, 34 suggest buying the stock, five have a hold call while three recommend selling it.DAM Capital has upgraded its rating on UltraTech Cement to buy and revised the target price to ₹12,550. The brokerage is of the view that structurally, the Indian cement sector should witness a breather led by uptick of government infra hereon. The slowing pace of consolidation may also result in an uptick in the sector. Meanwhile, UltraTech’s market share gains are likely to continue owing to 11% volume CAGR (compound annual growth rate) over FY25-27 compared to 6-7% industry CAGR.Jefferies has also retained its buy call on the shares of the cement company and set the target at ₹13,265 on the back of all-round recovery seen in Q3.It maintained UltraTech Cement as its top cement pick and believes that the recent price uptick and operating leverage will drive uptick in Q4 EBITDA or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation to ₹1,100-1,150/tonne. The brokerage expects a 14% volume CAGR in FY24-FY27.Nuvama, meanwhile, has revised its target price to ₹11,574 and retained its hold call. It has also marginally revised up FY25, FY26 and FY27 EBITDA estimates by 1% each factoring in better demand growth and pricing environment.During the quarter under review, UltraTech achieved a capacity utilisation of 73% during the quarter. Domestic sales volume grew 10% YoY. Energy costs were lower by 13% YoY and 4% QoQ mainly on account of decrease in fuel cost,” the firm said in a statement.

The company is currently expanding its capacity to 9.7 MTPA by 2025-26, and plans to increase it to 12 mtpa by 2027.\n\nThe company reported an 8 per cent increase in turnover last fiscal to ₹2,911 crore from ₹2,705 crore in FY23. The turnover was at ₹2,222 crore in FY’22.\n\nThe minority stake aquisition may lead to UltraTech Cement buying out Star Cement completely as it had done in the case of India Cements, said analysts.\n\nInitially, UltraTech Cement in June acquired 23 per cent stake in India Cements from DMart promoter Radhakishan Damani and his related entities for ₹1,889 crore expanding its footprint in the highly competitive and fast-growing southern cement market.\n\nThe following month it snapped 33 per cent stake in south-based cement major’s promoters for ₹3,954 crore and made an open offer to acquire another 26 per cent worth ₹3,142 crore.\n\nUltraTech has a capacity of over 150 mtpa spread across the country.\n\nIt took 36 years for the cement business of the Aditya Birla Group, to achieve a capacity of 100 mtpa but subsequently it added the next 50 mtpa in less than 5 years with an investment of about Rs 32,000 crore. Over the past two decades, UltraTech has grown 11 times, far outpacing the industry growth of 4 times.\n\nConsolidation\n\nThe cement industry is witnessing a consolidation and heightened rivalry between two corporate giants -- Kumar Mangalam Birla-led Aditya Birla Group and Gautam Adani-led Adani Group -- in snapping smaller players.\n\nThe Adani group has plans to raise its production capacity to 140 MTPA by FY28, just a shade below market leader UltraTech’s current capacity of 157 mtpa of grey cement.\n\nIt recently announced the acquisition of CK Birla group firm Orient Cement, through which it will achieve a capacity of 100 MT per annum by the end of FY25 and a gain of 2 per cent in the overall market share in the country.\n\nIt has completed the acquisition of Saurashtra-based Sanghi Industries and Penna Industries.\n\nAditya Birla group also plans to maintain its lead with 200 MTPA capacity by FY27. UltraTech is also in the process of acquiring Kesoram Industries’ cement business and is awaiting regulatory clearances.", "source_link": "https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/companies/ultratech-to-acquire-869-in-star-cement-for-851-crore/article69032365.ece", "keywords": ["UltraTech Cement", "Star Cement", "acquisition", "India Cements Ltd", "subsidiary"], "tags": ["Elections 2024", "merger, acquisition and takeover", "business (general)", "Live News"], "article_images": "https://bl-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/hbtb0i/article69032385.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/2024-10-21T084031Z_677517311_RC2VKV9ZRZSG_RTRMADP_3_ULTRATECH-CEMENT-RESULTS.JPG", "all_images": ["https://assetsbl.thehindubusinessline.com/theme/images/bl-online/menu-icon.svg", "https://assetsbl.thehindubusinessline.com/theme/images/bl-online/logo.svg", "https://assetsbl.thehindubusinessline.com/theme/images/bl-online/1x1_spacer.png", "https://assetsbl.thehindubusinessline.com/theme/images/BLRX/icon/bl-home-btn.png", "https://assetsbl.thehindubusinessline.com/theme/images/BLRX/icon/newsletter.svg", "https://assetsbl.thehindubusinessline.com/theme/images/google-signin/bl-online-icon.svg", "https://bl-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/hbtb0i/article69032385.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/2024-10-21T084031Z_677517311_RC2VKV9ZRZSG_RTRMADP_3_ULTRATECH-CEMENT-RESULTS.JPG", "https://assetsbl.thehindubusinessline.com/theme/images/BLRX/graph-arrow-icon.svg", "https://assetsbl.thehindubusinessline.com/theme/images/bl-online/comment-icon.svg", "https://assetsbl.thehindubusinessline.com/theme/images/th-online/1x1_spacer.png", "https://assetsbl.thehindubusinessline.com/theme/images/google-signin/group-12945.svg", "https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/theme/images/th-online/1x1_spacer.png", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=11398210&cs_ucfr=1&cv=4.4.0&cj=1"], "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "title": "UltraTech to acquire 8.69% in Star Cement for ₹851 crore", "description": "Star Cement expanding rapidly in north-eastern India, West Bengal, and Bihar with UltraTech acquiring minority stake.", "publish-date": "2024-12-27T10:59:40+05:30", "created-date": "2024-12-27T10:59:40+05:30", "modified-date": "2024-12-27T18:09:36+05:30", "article": {"published_time": "2024-12-27T05:29:40.000Z", "modified_time": "2024-12-27T12:39:36Z", "section": "Companies", "tag": "subsidiary", "author": "BL Mumbai Bureau"}, "cXenseParse": {"articleid": 69032365, "thg-articleid": 69032365, "thg-articletype": "storyline", "title": "UltraTech to acquire 8.69% in Star Cement for ₹851 crore", "description": "The development comes a few days after the Aditya Birla group firm completed the acquisition of a controlling stake in India Cements"}, "al": {"android": {"url": "https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/companies/ultratech-to-acquire-869-in-star-cement-for-851-crore/article69032365.ece", "app_name": "The HinduBusinessline"}}, "twitter": {"creator": "BL Mumbai Bureau", "title": "UltraTech to acquire 8.69% in Star Cement for ₹851 crore", "description": "Star Cement expanding rapidly in north-eastern India, West Bengal, and Bihar with UltraTech acquiring minority stake.", "image": "https://bl-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/hbtb0i/article69032385.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/2024-10-21T084031Z_677517311_RC2VKV9ZRZSG_RTRMADP_3_ULTRATECH-CEMENT-RESULTS.JPG", "app": {"id": {"googleplay": "app-id=com.mobstac.thehindubusinessline", "iphone": 855182339}, "name": {"googleplay": "Business Line", "ipad": "Business Line for iPad", "iphone": "The Hindu BusinessLine for iPhone"}}, "card": "summary_large_image", "domain": "thehindubusinessline.com", "site": "@businessline"}, "keywords": "UltraTech Cement,Star Cement,acquisition,India Cements Ltd,subsidiary", "news_keywords": "UltraTech Cement,Star Cement,acquisition,India Cements Ltd,subsidiary", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "atdlayout": "articlepage", "og": {"title": "UltraTech to acquire 8.69% in Star Cement for ₹851 crore", "description": "Star Cement expanding rapidly in north-eastern India, West Bengal, and Bihar with UltraTech acquiring minority stake.", "image": "https://bl-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/hbtb0i/article69032385.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/2024-10-21T084031Z_677517311_RC2VKV9ZRZSG_RTRMADP_3_ULTRATECH-CEMENT-RESULTS.JPG", "url": "https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/companies/ultratech-to-acquire-869-in-star-cement-for-851-crore/article69032365.ece", "type": "article", "site_name": "BusinessLine"}, "google-signin-client_id": "661011008554-l3k9f4nme8caoiei7t4rqipgh537si4d.apps.googleusercontent.com", "google-site-verification": "4QLs3xEIcfA9oMf-fpRqph1PcmPX-fc20j3O_0fd5z8", "fb": {"app_id": 137450626398044, "pages": 60573550946}}, "ambuja_kawach_count": 0, "ambuja_cool_walls_count": 0, "ambuja_compocem_count": 0, "ultratech_weather_pro_flex_count": 0, "shree_aac_blocks_count": 0, "ambuja_plus_count": 0, "ultratech_flex_count": 0, "shree_adhesives_count": 0},

Any new investor will not have a board seat,\" the sources close to the development said.\n\nAccording to the latest shareholding data, the total stake of all promoter shareholders with the surname Chamaria stands at 11.25%.\n\nThe development comes three days after the Aditya Birla group firm completed the acquisition of a controlling stake in India Cements Ltd, turning it into its subsidiary.\n\nThe firm is expanding its capacity through acquisitions and capacity enhancement as it faces competition from billionaire Gautam Adani-led Adani Group's Ambuja cement, which is the second largest player and is also scaling up its capacity.\n\nBoth the players are snapping up small cement players to consolidate their positions and achieve their targeted growth ahead of time.\n\nStar Cement has an installed capacity of 7.7 MTPA (million tonnes per annum) with a presence in the markets of north-eastern India and is expanding in eastern markets of West Bengal and Bihar.

The stake was worth around Rs 3,381 crore at the stock’s closing price on January 24.\n\nHeidelberg had drawn interest from major Indian cement makers such as Adani group and JSW Cement as well as UltraTech. A controlling stake sale will trigger a mandatory open offer under SEBI’s takeover norms, for acquiring a 26 percent stake from public shareholders.\n\nUltraTech’s plans to acquire a controlling stake in Heidelberg comes as the country’s biggest cement maker steps up focus on inorganic growth amid consolidation in the cement industry triggered by Adani group’s $6.6-billion acquisition of Ambuja Cements and ACC Limited in 2022 from Lafarge-Holcim.\n\nIn 2024, UltraTech acquired a 55.49 percent stake in Chennai-based India Cements. It picked up a 22.7 percent stake in India Cements in June. On July 28, UltraTech Cement announced it would purchase another 32.72 percent stake for Rs 3,954 crore at Rs 390 a share.

The pilot also included deployment of the charging infrastructure and imparting intensive training to the truck drivers.\n\nThe company is also evaluating additional routes for deployment of more EV trucks in its logistics operations. UltraTech proposes to conduct another pilot using a similar model for transport of clinker between two other manufacturing units of the company.\n\nThe transportation of clinker using these electric trucks in place of fossil-fuel based trucks is estimated to help reduce transport emissions by 17,000 tonne of CO2 annually.\n\nKC Jhanwar, Managing Director, UltraTech Cement said the scale up of EV trucks underscores the company’s commitment to drive the adopt sustainable practices and achieve net zero goal by 2050\n\nThe company introduced ‘Green Logistics’ in the form of CNG vehicles in 2021, LNG vehicles in 2022 and Electric Trucks in 2024.

It also formed a joint venture with Indorama Cement and later took control with full acquisition of the business by 2008.\n\nHeidelberg then merged the two companies in 2009 to form Heidelberg Cement India Ltd. Simultaneously, the company expanded further through fresh acquisitions, taking its annual cement capacity from 2.1 million tonnes to 5.4 mtpa.\n\nHeidelberg currently owns four integrated cement plants and a terminal in India, with total installed capacity of about 14 mtpa.\n\nHeidelberg owns 69.39 per cent stake in Heidelberg Cements India Ltd, which is worth around Rs3,381 crore, based on the stock’s closing price on Friday.\n\nAditya Birla group executives are reported to have recently discussed the proposal with apex management of the German cement maker.\n\nBesides UltraTech, other cement makers such as the Adani Group and JSW Cement are also reported to be in talks to acquire Heidelberg’s cement business in India.\n\nBusiness consolidation in the cement industry started with the Adani Group’s $6.6-billion acquisition of Ambuja Cements and ACC Limited in 2022 from Lafarge-Holcim.\n\nThis was followed by UltraTech’s acquisition of a 55.49 percent stake in Chennai-based India Cements. Earlier this month, the company launched an open offer to acquire an additional 26 per cent in India Cements.\n\nAnd, in December last year, UltraTech also acquired an 8.69 per cent stake in Star Cement.\n\nThe Aditya Birla Group is planning to expand its cement production capacity from around 150 million tonnes at present to 200 million tonnes over the next 10 years.\n\nAditya Birla Group flagship cement unit UltraTech Cement has a consolidated production capacity of 156.06 million tonnes of grey cement.\n\nAdani Group's cement arm, Ambuja Cement, is also poised for robust growth.

He expects an improvement in EBITDA per tonne, supported by effective cost management and better pricing.", "article_body": "₹\n\nShree Cement Managing Director Neeraj Akhoury remains firm on the company’s organic growth path, viewing it as more cost-effective and strategically aligned than pursuing acquisitions in the cement sector.Akhoury said that building new plants at $75 per tonne offers a clear advantage over high-priced acquisitions.\"When we build, we do so to our own designs and specifications, which helps reduce the cost of running these plants,\" he explained, highlighting the efficiencies inherent in organic growth.While Shree Cement has analysed acquisition opportunities, Akhoury said any move into inorganic growth would require a careful match with the company’s strategic goals.“It's not just about capex costs per tonne but also about strategic fit, plant quality, and the added value an acquisition could bring,” he said. In Q2FY25, the company reported a revenue of ₹3,727 crore, with a margin of 15.9% and a net profit of ₹93.1 crore.A: Last six months, the demand has not worked out in the way we were expecting. The country demand has been more flattish, and therefore, in the last quarter we had very deliberately looked at managing our revenues, managing our costs better.Going forward, I am very convinced that the demand pickup should happen the Q3 and Q4, demand for the year should be in line with our expectations. Already, we are seeing some green shoots, and therefore we will be back to our strategy of driving both volume and value in the in the coming quarters. Next year, of course, some of our new capacities will be coming online. There we do expect that our growth should be in in double-digits in FY26.A: FY25, we expect the remaining two quarters to grow at about 8 to 9% I am still very convinced that in cement, there is no nothing called destroyed demand, it is only a delayed demand. If this is true, then Q3 and Q4, we should be back on 8 to 9% demand growth. We will be growing in line with the market.A: 5% demand volume growth is what I would be expecting.A: EBITDA is a function of both prices and the cost. We are working rigorously on our managing our cost lines. Last quarter itself, we have been able to reduce our cost by about 8% on year-on-year basis. These efforts will continue even in thecoming quarters and coming here. What we see is we will be doing little better on cost, also, thanks to the tailwinds from fuel prices moderation across the globe.On pricing, it is a difficult judgment, we would not like to make any estimate. It will all depend on how the prices pan out. But looking at the fact that we are expecting a better volume environment, I believe pricing should also play out, and we should expect better than last quarter pricing in the next two quarters.A: We are very convinced about our organic growth. I think building a plant at $75 a ton is a better way to grow than buying at a very high price. At the same time, when we build we build designs to our specifications. Therefore, the cost of running those plants is also lower. I would say I am very convinced that our organic growth story has lot of meat in it, and this is what we should be doing in future as well. Having said that, please be aware that we are not against any acquisition opportunity. Whenever such a possibility is come in the market, we do study them, and if it will meet our expectations, we'll be very happy to participate.A: It’s just not about valuation. It’s also about strategic fit, the quality of plants and what is that we bring to the table if we make that acquisition. So it's a more detailed study. The capex cost per tonne is just one part of it. If it meets our requirement and expectations, we will be very interested to go for it.The company, which has a market capitalisation of87,046 crore, has seen its shares declined 8% over the last year.", "source_link": "https://www.cnbctv18.com/market/earnings/shree-cement-banking-demand-growth-over-next-two-quarters-19508006.htm", "keywords": ["Shree Cement", "Q2 earnings", "Shree Cement Q2 results", "Shree Cement share price", "Shree Cement stock price", "double-digit growth", ""], "tags": ["Results Boardroom", "Featured", "Shree Cement"], "article_images": "https://images.cnbctv18.com/uploads/2024/05/cement2-2024-05-17a4e503d4de3632c597e1091cc78645.jpg?im=FitAndFill,width=500,height=300", "all_images": ["https://www.cnbctv18.com/static/images/CNBC-TV18-logo-black.png", "https://images.cnbctv18.com/uploads/2024/05/cement2-2024-05-17a4e503d4de3632c597e1091cc78645.jpg?im=FitAndFill,width=500,height=300", "https://www.cnbctv18.com/static/images/author.png", "https://www.cnbctv18.com/static/images/bingelogo/binge-logo.png?impolicy=website&width=110&height=33", "https://www.cnbctv18.com/static/images/awaz-black.png", "https://www.cnbctv18.com/static/images/CNBC_Bajar.png", "https://images.cnbctv18.com/uploads/2024/11/shree-nov12-2024-11-3011bb95c6c2b271997b0a7bee7d1411.jpg?im=Resize,width=360,aspect=fit,type=normal", "https://www.cnbctv18.com/_next/static/media/gplay_1.fee9ff82.svg", "https://www.cnbctv18.com/static/images/common/cnbctv18-logo.png", "https://images.cnbctv18.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/stb-18.png?impolicy=website&width=100&height=41"], "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "keywords": "Shree Cement, Q2 earnings, Shree Cement Q2 results, Shree Cement share price, Shree Cement stock price, double-digit growth,", "news_keywords": "Shree Cement, Q2 earnings, Shree Cement Q2 results, Shree Cement share price, Shree Cement stock price, double-digit growth,", "description": "Neeraj Akhoury, MD of Shree Cement, forecasted double-digit growth for FY26.

Among them, UltraTech Cement stood out as the brokerage's top pick, praised for its pan-India presence, solid growth trajectory, and effective cost optimization strategies.According to JM Financial, the cement sector is positioned for significant recovery, supported by strong infrastructure growth, government housing initiatives, and urban housing revival. Demand in the industry is projected to grow at a 7-8% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over fiscal 2025 to 2027, stabilizing utilization rates at around 72% during this period.UltraTech Cement is expected to deliver a 24% potential upside, with a target price of Rs 13,000 per share. The company’s leadership in green power adoption, logistics optimization, and nationwide expansion further bolsters its favorable outlook.Ambuja Cements follows with a target price of Rs 685, offering a potential gain of 32.8%. Meanwhile, JK Cement is expected to see a 20.8% upside, with a target price of Rs 5,300 per share. ACC and Birla Corporation also received ‘buy’ ratings, with the brokerage expressing confidence in their growth potential, backed by improving sector fundamentals.The brokerage shed light on the transformative phase in the cement sector, driven by government expenditure on infrastructure and housing. JM Financial highlighted consolidation efforts, particularly those spearheaded by Adani and UltraTech, which have introduced greater pricing discipline and the potential for sustained profitability gains.Industry profitability, which hit multi-quarter lows in FY25 due to weak demand and intense competition, is expected to recover significantly. JM Financial said it anticipates an EBITDA CAGR of over 25% for the sector over FY25-27, supported by a stable pricing environment and improved operational efficiency.The brokerage said the industry's focus is on cost optimization and de-risking, which is expected to mitigate cyclicality in the long term. JM Financial noted, \"as a result, investors should look beyond short-term cement price fluctuations and focus on structural changes that are likely to drive long-term profitability.\"Despite the optimism, the brokerage attuned to a cautious tone regarding cement players in the South and East regions, which may face challenges due to aggressive capacity additions and intensified competition. Stocks like Shree Cement, Dalmia Bharat, and Star Cement have been assigned a \"hold\" rating, reflecting limited near-term upside potential.Also read | Up to 36% upside!

The results of our continued emphasis on operational excellence, efficiency improvements, and cost optimization are evident in our streamlined production costs this quarter. Looking ahead, we remain committed to increasing the volume of our premium product offerings and maintaining our relentless focus on further cost optimization.”\n\nCapex Plans\n\nThe Company’s ongoing expansion projects in Jaitaran, Rajasthan (6.0 MTPA), Kodla, Karnataka (3.00 MTPA), Baloda Bazar, Chhattisgarh (3.40 MTPA), and Etah, Uttar Pradesh (3.00 MTPA) are\n\nnearing completion. The Company expects to commission all these projects in the first quarter of FY25-26. The Company is continuously working to identify suitable opportunities to achieve its goal of achieving > 80 MTPA capacity by 2028.\n\nSustainability initiatives\n\nIn Q3 FY’25, the Company continued its efforts to improve its performance regarding its commitment to operational excellence and sustainable growth. Key highlights are:\n\n• The Company’s share of green electricity in total electricity consumption stood at 55.1% in Q3’FY25 which is one of the highest in the Indian cement industry. The Company is consistently ramping up its green power generation capacity which stood at 522 MW at the end of Q3’FY25, up by 9% vis-à-vis 480 MW at the beginning of the FY24-25.\n\n• The Company used 0.24 lakh tonnes of agro waste in its cement operations to conserve fossil fuel equivalent to producing 71 billion kCal and saving 0.28 lakh tonnes of CO2. As part of this agro waste consumption, the Company procured 7,130 tonnes of stubble during the quarter for its operations within the NCR region. The Company also consumed 1.04 lakh tonnes of hazardous waste during Q3’FY25, replacing the fossil fuel-based heat by 50.4 billion kCal.\n\n• All the Company’s manufacturing locations are Zero Liquid Discharge, treating, recycling, and reusing 100% of wastewater generated from our operations. With a good monsoon this year, the Company aims to improve its water positively level of >7 times achieved in FY23-24.\n\n• During the quarter, the Company commenced operations of its state-of-the-art, end-to-end solid waste feeding system for municipal solid waste consumption at one of its locations and this is being replicated at other plants also. This initiative shall help us enhance proportion of alternative fuel consumption and improve TSR level.\n\nDividend\n\nThe Board of Directors, in today’s meeting, declared an interim dividend of ₹50/- per share (500%) for the year 2024-25.\n\nCement market outlook\n\nWe expect the cement demand to grow on the back of likely increase in rural consumption aided by improved farm cash flows, sustained healthy demand for urban housing and expected increase in government spending on infrastructure projects. This augurs well for the cement industry going forward.", "source_link": "https://www.apnnews.com/shree-cement-announces-q3fy25-results-strong-60-quarterly-ebitda-growth-led-by-robust-performance-on-cost-and-price-levers/", "keywords": [""], "tags": [], "article_images": "https://www.apnnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-124.png", "all_images": ["https://www.apnnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-124.png", "https://www.apnnews.com/wp-content/themes/jnews/assets/img/jeg-empty.png", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5cb340ea607bfb20d925ee472d8bab8e?s=80&d=mm&r=g", "https://www.apnnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-124-1024x225.png", "https://new.apnnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/logo-2.png", "https://www.apnnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/logo-2.png"], "article_metadata": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Shree Cement announces Q3’FY25 results, Strong 60% quarterly EBITDA growth led by robust performance on cost and price levers - APN News", "site_name": "APN News", "description": "Bengaluru  – Shree Cement, India’s third largest cement group by capacity, today announced its financial results for the quarter and nine months ended on 31st December, 2024.

This means the dividend...", "article_body": "Shree Cement Limited ( ) will pay a dividend of ₹50.00 on the 17th of February. This means the dividend yield will be fairly typical at 0.4%.\n\nShree Cement's Projected Earnings Seem Likely To Cover Future Distributions\n\nWe like to see a healthy dividend yield, but that is only helpful to us if the payment can continue. Based on the last payment, Shree Cement was earning enough to cover the dividend, but free cash flows weren't positive. With the company not bringing in any cash, paying out to shareholders is bound to become difficult at some point.\n\nOver the next year, EPS is forecast to expand by 127.2%. If the dividend continues on this path, the payout ratio could be 15% by next year, which we think can be pretty sustainable going forward.\n\nShree Cement Has A Solid Track Record\n\nThe company has an extended history of paying stable dividends. Since 2015, the annual payment back then was ₹22.00, compared to the most recent full-year payment of ₹105.00. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 17% per annum over that time. So, dividends have been growing pretty quickly, and even more impressively, they haven't experienced any notable falls during this period.\n\nDividend Growth May Be Hard To Achieve\n\nInvestors could be attracted to the stock based on the quality of its payment history. However, initial appearances might be deceiving. Over the past five years, it looks as though Shree Cement's EPS has declined at around 2.4% a year. If the company is making less over time, it naturally follows that it will also have to pay out less in dividends. Earnings are forecast to grow over the next 12 months and if that happens we could still be a little bit cautious until it becomes a pattern.\n\nIn Summary\n\nOverall, it's nice to see a consistent dividend payment, but we think that longer term, the current level of payment might be unsustainable. With cash flows lacking, it is difficult to see how the company can sustain a dividend payment. Overall, we don't think this company has the makings of a good income stock.\n\nInvestors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock.

Further, higher rural demand is expected on the back of good kharif crop and improved farm prices,” the company said in its outlook.“Spending under additional houses in the PMAY scheme (rural and urban) and increase in industrial & commercial capex is also expected to drive cement demand in the near future,” it said.Shree Cement currently has a production capacity of nearly 47 million tonne, and aims to increase this to more than 80 million tonne by 2028. It is currently expanding capacities at Jaitaran in Rajasthan, Kodla in Karnataka, Baloda Bazar in Chhattisgarh and Etah in Uttar Pradesh.", "source_link": "https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/earnings/shree-cement-q2-results-profit-plunges-over-80-to-rs-93-crore-on-weak-demand-prices/articleshow/115188656.cms", "keywords": ["shree cement", "cement demand in India", "shree cement", "q2 results", "earnings", "profit", "revenue", "pat", "share price", "cement stock"], "tags": ["share price", "earnings", "pat", "profit", "cement stock", "cement demand in India"], "article_images": "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-115188650,width-1200,height-630,imgsize-49542,overlay-etmarkets/articleshow.jpg", "all_images": ["https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-117790307/et-EaseBuzz.jpg", "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-118147714,imgsize-44796,width-138,height-104/prime/transportation/this-key-bill-has-a-bagful-of-gifts-for-indian-airlines-global-aircraft-leasing-firms.jpg", "https://img.etb2bimg.com/files/retail_files/1246_cover_image_1724931917_29486.jpg", "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-76920425,quality-100/et-logo.jpg", "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-74462387,quality-100/et-logo.jpg", "https://img.etb2bimg.com/files/retail_files/expert_picture_1726637632_1726637632_73876.jpg", "https://img.etb2bimg.com/files/retail_files/expert_4718_picture_1724304120_47831.jpg", "https://img.etb2bimg.com/files/retail_files/1295_cover_image_1726139388_62558.jpg", "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-115188650,width-210,height-158,imgsize-49542,resizemode-75/shree-cements-profit-plunges-over-80-on-weak-demand-prices.jpg", "https://img.etb2bimg.com/files/retail_files/expert_picture_1724908793_1724908793_60514.jpg", "https://img.etb2bimg.com/files/retail_files/1257_cover_image_1726142613_10173.jpg", "https://img.etimg.com/photo/94935185.cms", "https://img.etb2bimg.com/files/retail_files/1268_cover_image_1727757799_96565.jpg", "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-115188650,width-1200,height-630,imgsize-49542,overlay-etmarkets/articleshow.jpg", "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-118154648,imgsize-83908,width-138,height-104/prime/technology-and-startups/7-things-zomato-swiggy-zepto-et-al-do-to-stay-ahead-of-the-game.jpg", "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-118150118,imgsize-1021705,width-138,height-104/prime/technology-and-startups/shadowfax-takes-a-critical-leap-can-it-become-a-premium-logistics-brand-with-criticalog.jpg", "https://img.etb2bimg.com/files/retail_files/expert_4721_picture_1724919266_72318.jpg", "https://img.etb2bimg.com/files/retail_files/1454_cover_image_1728974373_67157.jpg", "https://img.etb2bimg.com/files/retail_files/1451_cover_image_1728906251_68967.jpg", "https://img.etb2bimg.com/files/retail_files/1260_cover_image_1726142436_53655.jpg", "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-118139829,imgsize-12694,width-138,height-104/prime/economy-and-policy/why-your-loan-rate-is-rising-despite-rbi-rate-cut.jpg", "https://img.etb2bimg.com/files/retail_files/expert_picture_1735043844_1735043844_10242.jpg", "https://img.etimg.com/photo/47865640.cms", "https://img.etb2bimg.com/files/retail_files/1278_cover_image_1726141941_17705.jpg", "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-74451948,quality-100/et-logo.jpg", "https://img.etb2bimg.com/files/retail_files/expert_4717_picture_1724303903_89700.jpg", "https://img.etb2bimg.com/files/retail_files/1248_cover_image_1724933211_74145.jpg", "https://img.etb2bimg.com/files/retail_files/expert_picture_1725970002_1725970002_33110.jpg", "https://img.etb2bimg.com/files/retail_files/1249_cover_image_1724933517_62776.jpg", "https://img.etb2bimg.com/files/retail_files/expert_picture_1726127940_1726127940_30427.jpg", "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/width-513,height-50,msid-115075348/growfast.jpg", "https://img.etb2bimg.com/files/retail_files/1279_cover_image_1726141745_62528.jpg", "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-118155835,imgsize-50024,width-138,height-104/prime/technology-and-startups/zomato-swiggys-dilemma-in-dealing-with-a-q-comm-dark-horse.jpg", "https://img.etimg.com/photo/msid-76920540,quality-100/et-markets-logo.jpg", "https://img.etb2bimg.com/files/retail_files/1284_cover_image_1726141084_71082.jpg", "https://img.etb2bimg.com/files/retail_files/1247_cover_image_1724932982_31573.jpg", "https://img.etb2bimg.com/files/retail_files/1259_cover_image_1726142561_15832.jpg", "https://img.etb2bimg.com/files/retail_files/1532_cover_image_1735042645_54387.jpg", "https://img.etimg.com/photo/104857408.cms", "https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-118174651,imgsize-81822,width-138,height-104/prime/technology-and-startups/3-big-shifts-emerging-from-ais-party-in-paris.jpg", "https://img.etb2bimg.com/files/retail_files/expert_picture_1725868239_1725868239_50337.jpg"], "article_metadata": {"description": "Shree Cement reported a significant drop in profit for the September quarter.

Management plans to commission 14mn MT cement capacity in Q1FY26 to reach 70mn MT.Cement NSR fell only 0.4% QoQ, lower vs peers owing to a rise in trade sakes QoQ. Unit opex went up 2% QoQ, mainly on op-lev loss. Thus, unit EBITDA fell INR 170/MT QoQ to INR 780 per MT (down INR 280/ MT YoY.A few strategic changes, such as a focus on brand equity and product premiumization, are near-term hurdles in gaining market share despite capacity expansions.The company reinstated a few previous brands, such as Roofon, under the premium category, and Shree Jungrodhak under the master brand Bangur, which also led to uncertainties over the company’s marketing strategies. Motilal Oswal continues to believe most of the company’s expansions focus on existing markets (North, East, and part of South), while a large part of Central India and West will remain untapped until FY27E.The company’s capex plan shall help deliver sustained volume growth while cost efficiency measures would allow it to sustain cost leadership in the cement industry.

Revenue also dropped 15%.\n\nPhotograph: Amit Dave/Reuters\n\nNew Delhi, Nov 11 (PTI) Bangur family-promoted Shree Cement Ltd on Monday reported 82.83 per cent decline in consolidated net profit at Rs 76.64 crore for September quarter FY25 as it faced challenging demand conditions on account of prolonged monsoon and lower price in the segment.\n\n\n\nThe company had logged a net profit of Rs 446.62 crore in the July-September period a year ago, according to a regulatory filing from Shree Cement Ltd (SCL).\n\n\n\nRevenue from operations was down 15.07 per cent year-on-year to Rs 4,054.17 crore during the quarter.\n\n\n\nLike other cement makers, SCL also faced \"challenging demand conditions on account of prolonged monsoon and softer prices faced by the industry,\" the company said in its earning statement.\n\n\n\nEBITDA stood at Rs 593 crore against Rs 870 crore in the corresponding quarter of the previous year.\n\n\n\nTotal expense was at Rs 4,212.27 crore, down 3.52 per cent from the year-ago period. Total sale volumes came down by 7 per cent to 7.60 million tonne as against 8.20 million tonne.\n\n\n\nTotal income, which includes other income, was also down 13.65 per cent to Rs 4,235.55 crore in the September quarter.\n\n\n\n\"Despite strong headwinds on account of extended monsoon and softer pricing environment across the industry, Shree Cement has delivered a steady performance on the back of accelerated operational efficiency measures, focused cost optimisation drive and product premiumisation initiatives, Managing Director Neeraj Akhoury said.\n\n\n\nOver the outlook, he said SCL expects gradual improvement in demand driven by increased government spending in the second half of the financial year and improved demand from urban and rural segments owing to good monsoon.\n\n\n\n\"Shree Cement remains focused on its long-term growth and sustainability, with ongoing investments in capacity expansion and the adoption of greener technologies, he said.\n\n\n\nShares of SCL on Monday settled at Rs 24,389.75 apiece on BSE, down 0.66 per cent from the previous close.\n\nHome » Market News » Shree Cement Q2 Profit Plunges 83% to Rs 77 cr | News\n\nDISCLAIMER - This article is from a syndicated feed.

Shree Cement’s CSR initiatives have positively impacted over 6.7 lakh individuals, demonstrating the widespread reach and effectiveness of our programs. Some of the standout projects include large-scale education initiatives, such as the upgrade of school infrastructure and the provision of essential teaching aids and educational materials. These efforts have created a more conducive environment for students to learn and grow, ultimately contributing to higher literacy rates in the areas we serve. In addition, we have contributed to the improvement of rural infrastructure, including the construction of vital roads and other essential community facilities that improve the quality of life for residents. Healthcare is another area of focus, with our mobile health vans providing vital services to remote and underserved areas. Our maternal care programs have helped ensure that pregnant women have access to the necessary care, contributing to improved health outcomes for mothers and babies alike. Another key initiative is our women empowerment programs, which offer skill development training in areas like stitching and beautician courses, as well as our Marriage Support Program. To measure the success of these programs, we track important metrics such as the number of lives impacted, tangible improvements in literacy rates, health outcomes and the overall quality of life. Feedback from the communities is also crucial, helping us understand the effectiveness of our initiatives and allowing us to continuously improve our efforts.\n\nQ. Women empowerment and skill development are critical areas of focus for Shree Cement. Can you provide more details about the specific programs you have implemented in these areas and the tangible outcomes for the communities?\n\nA. Shree Cement is deeply committed to empowering women and helping them achieve financial independence, which is why we have implemented a range of programs designed to provide women with the skills and resources they need to succeed. Through initiatives like stitching and beautician courses, we have equipped many women with valuable skills that enable them to generate a steady income, improving their household incomes and overall livelihoods. Beyond skill development, we have also launched the Marriage Support Program under Shree Samaj Sewa, which provides crucial financial assistance to Below Poverty Line (BPL) families for the marriages of their daughters. This program not only helps families alleviate the financial burden associated with marriage but also promotes social equity by supporting those in need. As a result of these initiatives, women have gained greater financial independence and a stronger voice in household decision-making. The programs have helped foster a sense of self-reliance, improving the socio-economic stability of families and contributing to the empowerment of women across our project areas. The tangible benefits of these programs can be seen in the growing participation of women in community activities and decision-making processes, helping to create more inclusive and equal communities.\n\nQ. The healthcare initiatives, especially in maternal and child healthcare, appear to be an important focus. Could you elaborate on how these programs have improved health outcomes in the communities Shree Cement serves?\n\nA. At Shree Cement, we understand the importance of health in creating thriving communities and that’s why we have placed a strong emphasis on improving maternal and child healthcare. Our healthcare initiatives are designed to address some of the most pressing health concerns in rural and underserved areas. We organize free health camps across various villages, where local residents can access medical consultations, treatments and necessary medicines at no cost. These camps have proven to be vital for people who otherwise might not have access to essential healthcare services. We also run immunization drives to protect children from preventable diseases and work to eradicate malnutrition in the areas where we operate. In addition, we have partnered with government bodies to enhance maternal care services, promoting institutional deliveries and raising awareness about the importance of maternal and child healthcare. Through these collaborations, we have been able to ensure that pregnant women in rural areas have access to skilled medical care, which has been crucial in reducing maternal and infant mortality rates. Our focus on adolescent healthcare also ensures that young people receive the necessary care and education to maintain their health. As a result of these initiatives, we have seen improved health outcomes, with better access to healthcare services and a stronger emphasis on preventative care. These efforts have contributed to healthier and more resilient communities, creating a foundation for long-term well-being.\n\n\n\nQ. Sustainability is a key pillar of Shree Cement’s strategy, especially with a 55.9% green energy share. Can you discuss the company’s journey toward sustainability and the role these initiatives play in reducing your carbon footprint?\n\nA. India’s rapid economic growth, marked by its emergence as the fifth-largest global economy, presents a critical challenge: driving industrial progress while protecting the environment. For the cement industry, the third-largest energy consumer in the country, this responsibility is immense. At Shree Cement, sustainability is deeply embedded in our operations, reflecting our commitment to reducing our carbon footprint and embracing clean energy solutions.\n\nWith 55.9% of our total power needs met through green energy, Shree Cement has established itself as a leader in the transition toward sustainable industrial practices. Our clinkerization plants are equipped with Waste Heat Recovery Systems (WHRS), which enable the conversion of waste heat into usable energy, significantly reducing our dependence on conventional power sources. Alongside WHRS, our renewable energy portfolio includes 219 MW of solar power and 56.3 MW of wind energy, bringing our total green energy capacity to 517 MW.\n\nThese initiatives represent more than technological advancements; they are a reflection of our responsibility toward the planet. By shifting away from coal and grid electricity, we achieve substantial reductions in greenhouse gas emissions while improving operational efficiency and reducing costs. This dual benefit aligns seamlessly with global decarbonisation goals and reinforces our commitment to Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) standards.\n\nQ. Shree Cement is committed to the RE100 initiative and aims for 100% renewable electricity by 2050. How are you working towards this ambitious goal and what steps are being taken to ensure the success of this commitment?\n\nA. Shree Cement’s commitment to achieving 100% renewable electricity by 2050 under the RE100 initiative is firmly rooted in a clear and focused strategy. By steadily increasing our renewable electricity capacity—now at 275.3 MW as of November 2024—we are making measurable progress toward this ambitious goal. This growth reflects our ongoing investments in solar and wind energy while maintaining our commitment to avoiding any new thermal power capacities. Additionally, more than 110 MW of renewable energy projects are in various stages of development with an approximate capital expenditure of ₹450 crore. Every step we take is guided by the principle of prioritizing clean sustainable energy solutions contributing to reducing our environmental footprint and advancing the global transition to renewable energy.\n\nQ. Infrastructure development is a significant part of your CSR efforts. Can you provide examples of specific community infrastructure projects, such as sanitation, water access, and public utility spaces, and their impact on the quality of life in underserved areas?\n\nA. Infrastructure development has been at the core of our efforts to uplift underserved communities and improve their quality of life. Through Shree Samaj Sewa, we have undertaken projects such as constructing toilets, providing safe drinking water facilities, developing public parks and enhancing rural roads and school buildings. These initiatives have had a significant impact, improving sanitation and health outcomes, boosting mobility and increasing access to education. By focusing on infrastructure that directly addresses the daily needs of communities, we aim to create lasting, positive change, fostering better living conditions and sustainable growth in the areas we serve.\n\nQ. Shree Cement has made notable strides in environmental leadership. Could you expand on the company's efforts in water conservation and any innovative projects aimed at fostering environmental sustainability?\n\nA. Water conservation has been a key focus area in our environmental sustainability efforts. We have undertaken rainwater harvesting projects at government schools and worked on deepening water bodies and ponds in villages to enhance water storage capacity. These initiatives have had a positive impact on groundwater recharge, helping to secure water resources for the local communities. Additionally, we actively support farmers by providing them with improved seeds, agricultural training and exposure to better crop management practices. This includes guidance on seed treatment, fertilizer use and sustainable farming techniques aimed at increasing productivity.\n\nWe also offer subsidies on agricultural equipment and provide high-yielding seeds, further empowering farmers to enhance their yields. To promote greenery and improve the local environment, we have distributed saplings to farmers, encouraging mass plantation efforts and boosting vegetation in nearby villages. Through these combined efforts, we strive to contribute to both environmental sustainability and the economic well-being of the communities we serve.\n\nQ. How has Shree Cement's adoption of advanced technologies improved quality, efficiency and environmental impact in cement manufacturing, and how do these innovations contribute to the success of your CSR initiatives?\n\nA. Our adoption of digital tools and technologies has transformed the way we manage resources, streamline operations, and boost productivity across the value chain. SAP’ integration has improved the quality of work from raw material handling to production and logistics, reducing waste and optimizing energy use. Real-time order management and communication through UdaanPRO and UdaanCONNECT have empowered sales within the teams and partners, ensuring greater efficiency in meeting market demands while reducing operational delays and emissions.\n\nThese technological advancements don’t just optimize our internal processes, they are instrumental in driving our Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiatives. By increasing operational efficiency, we’ve been able to direct more resources towards environmental sustainability and community empowerment. For example, our continuous investment in renewable energy now accounts for 55.9% of our energy consumption, reducing reliance on non-renewable sources and contributing to a cleaner environment. Furthermore, the technology enables better water management, with innovations in rainwater harvesting and wastewater recycling, allowing us to conserve vital resources and reduce our environmental footprint.\n\nIn terms of CSR impact, these technological developments enable us to allocate resources more effectively to key areas such as women empowerment, health and education, infrastructure development and supporting the families of martyred soldiers through Project Naman which is a tribute to the bravery of our armed and paramilitary forces, helping build homes for the dependents of martyrs. The enhanced efficiency and resource optimization mean that we can extend our reach and make a more significant difference in the communities we serve. Moreover, digital platforms help us stay in tune with community needs by enabling real-time feedback, ensuring that our CSR efforts are not only effective but also responsive to the evolving challenges faced by these communities.", "source_link": "https://thecsruniverse.com/articles/driving-sustainability-and-empowering-communities-shree-cement-s-holistic-approach-to-csr-and-green-energy", "keywords": [""], "tags": [], "article_images": "https://thecsruniverse.com/adminxsafe/uploads/Shree Cement Satish.jpg", "all_images": ["https://thecsruniverse.com/adminxsafe/uploads/Green Tourism Picture.jpg", "https://thecsruniverse.com/adminxsafe/uploads/ATE Cover.JPG", "https://thecsruniverse.com/assets/images/search.svg", "https://thecsruniverse.com/uploads/image5news.jpg", "https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=3807825&fmt=gif", "https://thecsruniverse.com/adminxsafe/uploads/Metropolis Duru Shah Cover.jpg", "https://thecsruniverse.com/assets/images/in.png", "https://thecsruniverse.com/adminxsafe/uploads/AIC Pinnacle Cover.jpg", "https://thecsruniverse.com/adminxsafe/uploads/Image 3- Open Letter.jpg", "https://thecsruniverse.com/assets/images/fb.png", "https://thecsruniverse.com/assets/images/home-icon.png", "https://thecsruniverse.com/adminxsafe/uploads/Marico Amit Cover 2.jpg", "https://thecsruniverse.com/adminxsafe/uploads/Girnar Pihu Cover 1.jpeg", "https://thecsruniverse.com/adminxsafe/uploads/Shree Cement Satish.jpg", "https://thecsruniverse.com/adminxsafe/uploads/Pernod Ricard Cover Gagandeep.jpg", "https://thecsruniverse.com/assets/images/x.png", "https://thecsruniverse.com/adminxsafe/uploads/Google PhD Fellowship Picture.jpg", "https://thecsruniverse.com/assets/images/logo.png", "https://thecsruniverse.com/assets/images/follow-us-on-linkedin.png", "https://thecsruniverse.com/adminxsafe/uploads/Plastic Vs Planet 2.jpg", "https://thecsruniverse.com/adminxsafe/uploads/A20250208021728.jpg", "https://thecsruniverse.com/adminxsafe/uploads/mpocket Rajani Jalan.jpeg", "https://thecsruniverse.com/adminxsafe/uploads/Kotak Mahindra Himanshu Cover.jpg", "https://thecsruniverse.com/adminxsafe/uploads/RR Kabel Kriti.jpg", "https://thecsruniverse.com/adminxsafe/uploads/Godrej Interview Ashwini Cover.jpg", "https://thecsruniverse.com/adminxsafe/uploads/A20241202123219.png", "https://thecsruniverse.com/adminxsafe/uploads/Arya Mobility Story 1.jpg"], "article_metadata": {"description": "In this interview with Mr Satish Chander, Chief Manufacturing Officer, Shree Cement, we delve into Shree Cement’s multifaceted approach to Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and sustainability.

As the second-largest cement producer globally, India must address its significant carbon footprint. Satish Chander, Chief Manufacturing Officer at Shree Cement , shared the company's eco-friendly initiatives with ET Digital.Chander says Shree Cement has made notable strides in reducing its environmental impact. By harnessing waste heat recovery systems, the company has decreased its reliance on traditional energy sources. This innovative approach converts waste heat into electricity, yielding lower energy costs.Additionally, Shree Cement is pioneering the production of low-carbon cements, significantly mitigating the environmental effects of its manufacturing processes. Edited excerpts:At Shree Cement, nearly 56% of Shree Cement's power requirements for FY2023-24 were met through renewable energy, positioning the company as an industry leader in the Indian cement sector in terms of sustainability. The shift towards green energy is driven by a combination of strategies and technologies, including an energy portfolio of 480 MW from solar, wind and Waste Heat Recovery (WHR) systems. These technologies help reduce dependence on traditional power sources and significantly cut energy costs.Further bolstering this renewable energy shift, the company has already enhanced its green electricity capacity to 520 MW during the current financial year. The company is in the process of implementing an additional 110 MW of renewable energy capacity, with investments exceeding Rs 450 crore.India’s cement sector is among the largest in the world, with the country being the second-largest producer of cement globally. The challenge of carbon emissions is inherent to the cement manufacturing process. Shree Cement's efforts to reduce emissions, invest in renewable energy and pioneer low-carbon cement production put the company at the forefront of the Indian industry in its sustainability journey.While the cement sector globally is pushing for a greener future, India has significant opportunities to scale up its renewable energy integration, reduce carbon intensity and enhance efficiency.Shree Cement currently boasts a renewable energy portfolio of 520 MW, which includes a blend of solar, wind and Waste Heat Recovery (WHR) systems. These sources collectively account for more than 50% of the company’s total installed electricity capacity.In line with the commitment to achieve 100% renewable electricity by 2050 under the RE100 initiative, the company is investing Rs 450 crore in the development of an additional 110 MW of renewable capacity. In addition to solar and wind projects, Shree Cement is exploring emerging technologies like Battery Energy Storage and Pumped Hydro Energy Storage.Although green energy infrastructure can be capital-intensive, Shree Cement has effectively managed and controlled operational costs through strategic investments, technological innovations, and operational efficiencies. The company’s investment in Waste Heat Recovery (WHR) systems, for instance, has proven to be a cost-effective solution for generating electricity from the waste heat produced during cement manufacturing.By capturing and converting waste heat into electricity, Shree Cement has reduced its dependence on traditional energy sources, thereby lowering energy costs in the long run. Similarly, the use of captive solar and wind electricity reduces the dependence on external sources of electricity and provides substantial savings in energy costs. Additionally, the company’s focus on alternative fuels, such as agro waste, has helped reduce reliance on fossil fuels, further curbing operational expenses. In-house innovations, such as synthetic gypsum production using hazardous waste from other industries, also contribute to cost savings and resource optimisation.Low-carbon cements such as PPC ( Portland Pozzolana Cement ), PSC (Portland Slag Cement) and CC (Composite Cement) are crucial in reducing Shree Cement’s overall carbon emissions. These products replace a significant portion of clinker, the most energy-intensive component of traditional cement, with more sustainable cementitious alternatives like fly ash and slag. By lowering the reliance on clinker, these blended cements require less energy and less limestone to produce, which in turn reduces their carbon footprint.PPC incorporates fly ash, a by-product of coal combustion, helping to reduce both carbon emissions and landfill waste. PSC uses slag from steel manufacturing, which further cuts CO2 emissions by decreasing the need for clinker. CC substitutes both fly ash and slag for clinker, providing another option to lower carbon emissions in cement production.Through the production of these low-carbon cements, Shree Cement is significantly reducing the environmental impact of its manufacturing processes.Yes, Shree Cement has set ambitious sustainability targets to ensure that its growth is aligned with global climate goals and the company’s commitment to environmental stewardship. By 2030, the company aims to reduce its Scope 1 emissions by 12.7% and Scope 2 emissions by 27.1%, both compared to 2019 levels. These targets reflect Shree Cement’s proactive approach to lowering its carbon footprint and improving its sustainability performance.Additionally, we are determined to achieve zero waste to landfill and zero wastewater discharge from our manufacturing facilities every year. Looking ahead, the company has a goal to achieve 100% renewable electricity by 2050, in line with its participation in the RE100 initiative. The company is also focused on expanding its production capacity to over 80 MTPA by 2028.", "source_link":

Management indicated that cement demand will remain weak until CY24-end, which will also adversely impact prices.Emkay Global maintained an add rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 27,300.Change in the geographical mix (with increased share in the East), higher lead distance (+21km QoQ), and stabilization cost for new plants have impacted profitability in the quarter.
